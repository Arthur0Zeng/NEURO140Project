"PLTR, SOUN, or NVDA: Which AI Stock Scores Wall Street’s “Strong Buy” Rating? - TipRanks",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxOWVhuWlE4SWp6OVVGZ1g1SkZSbEFNYVNWdEJkNnB3eEM0Vk9PcEYxWnJ6Yzh2UVZCcjRneVdfN2ZCUU1RZTA4RHFJVFZHT0pLcTFNWk1nWnRSbWRQSFk0c3NVWGwtOENUZEtXaEQ0ajRKUm11djBCcVNHWXEyblBZVGhFTWpjYkM3X1JVdnY2WUxvZnVNMmNFYWM1U1NMd3NkWGc?oc=5,"Sun, 04 May 2025 06:08:05 GMT","AI (artificial intelligence) stocks have been volatile this year due to news around tariff wars, concerns about a slowdown in spending due to macro uncertainties, and growing competition from Chinese rivals. Despite short-term pressures, Wall Street remains bullish on some AI players due to their ability to withstand near-term headwinds and capitalize on the solid growth opportunities in the generative AI space over the long term. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we will compare Palantir Technologies (PLTR), SoundHound AI (SOUN), and Nvidia (NVDA) to find the AI stock that scores a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from Wall Street.

Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR)

Data analytics company Palantir Technologies has been impressing investors with its solid financials in recent quarters, supported by robust demand for its AI-powered offerings across its Commercial and Government businesses. Notably, the company’s AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) offering has been driving solid growth.

PLTR stock has rallied 64% year-to-date, massively outperforming the broader market. However, several analysts are cautious on the stock due to its lofty valuation, concerns about the impact of a potential economic slowdown on PLTR’s Commercial business, and the impact of government spending cuts on its Government business.

Palantir is scheduled to announce its first-quarter results on May 5, after the markets close. Analysts expect PLTR to report EPS (earnings per share) of $0.13, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 62.5%. Moreover, Q1 revenue is expected to rise about 36% to $862.17 million.

Is Palantir Stock a Strong Buy?

Heading into the results, UBS analyst Karl Keirstead reiterated a Hold rating on Palantir Technologies stock with a price target of $105. After interacting with six Commercial and Government customers to assess their spend intentions, the 5-star analyst concluded that the company seems very resilient. However, one key risk that PLTR is exposed to is Federal deal delays that his checks reveal are happening currently.

While Keirstead is constructive on Palantir’s fundamentals, he remains on the sidelines due to the solid year-to-date rally in the stock and its steep valuation multiple at about 123x 2026 free cash flow (estimate).

Wall Street has a Hold consensus rating on Palantir Technologies stock based on three Buys, 12 Holds, and three Sell recommendations. The average PLTR stock price target of $93.69 implies 24.6% downside risk from current levels.

SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN)

SoundHound AI is a conversational AI specialist that offers voice AI solutions across automotive, TV, IoT, and customer service industries. The company gained spotlight when Nvidia disclosed its stake in the emerging AI player.

However, the semiconductor giant offloaded its entire stake in SOUN stock in the fourth quarter of 2024. SOUN stock has plunged about 53% so far in 2025. Nonetheless, the company is focused on driving further growth through continued innovation and strategic deals. Last year, SoundHound acquired Amelia, an enterprise AI software company, to expand its scale and reach in new verticals like healthcare and financial services.

SoundHound is scheduled to announce its first-quarter results on May 8. Analysts expect the company to report a narrower loss per share of $0.09 compared to $0.12 in the prior-year quarter. They expect SoundHound to deliver revenue of $30.86 million, reflecting a 166% year-over-year growth.

Is SoundHound AI Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Ahead of the results, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria lowered his price target for SoundHound stock to $10 from $13, while maintaining a Buy rating. In a broader research note on D.A. Davidson’s Software group, the analyst said that the firm is now assuming a base case of one or two quarters of negative GDP in the U.S. in 2025, translating into to lower growth, with valuations already down.

The analyst added that regardless of how the current tariff scenario plays out, he sees a slowdown in consumer activity and corporate investment, at least for the next couple of quarters.

With three Buys and two Holds, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on SoundHound AI stock. The average SOUN stock price target of $14.90 implies about 59% upside potential.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)

After witnessing a strong rally last year, Nvidia stock is down 15% year-to-date. Chip export restrictions, tariff wars, concerns about rising competition in the AI chips space from players like China’s Huawei Technologies, and a slowdown or decline in AI spending.

However, most analysts are looking beyond the ongoing headwinds and are confident about Nvidia’s ability to capture continued demand for AI chips through its innovative offerings like the Blackwell platform.

Nvidia is scheduled to announce its results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2026 on May 28. Analysts expect Q1 EPS of $0.89, reflecting a year-over-year growth of about 46%. Revenue is estimated to rise 66% to $43.1 billion.

What Is the Prediction for Nvidia Stock?

Recently, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $150. The 5-star analyst highlighted strong performance expectations and the company’s solid positioning in the AI infrastructure market. Arya expects to deliver a modest sales beat for Q1, with revenue expected to come in at $44 billion compared to the street’s consensus estimate of $43 billion.

While Arya acknowledged some expected headwinds in the second quarter due to geopolitical pressures and the ban related to China exports, he views these challenges as manageable and believes that they have already been priced into the stock price. He also highlighted NVDA stock’s valuation, trading at the lower end of its historical range. He added that the company’s offerings continue to see solid support from U.S. cloud customers.

Overall, Wall Street remains bullish on Nvidia stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 34 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average NVDA stock price target of $164.23 implies 43.4% upside potential.

Conclusion

Despite the ongoing pressures, Wall Street remains highly bullish on Nvidia stock while being cautiously optimistic on SoundHound and sidelined on Palantir. The consensus estimate on NVDA stock is a “Strong Buy” based on analysts’ optimism about continued demand for the company’s GPUs in building and training AI models, solid financials, innovation, and management’s strong execution.

"NVDA Stock Is Not “Fully Pricing in” Its Positive Attributes, Analyst Says - Yahoo Finance",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5pQzctY1NvN2NNZjBudlFXQmhrSm5HR24yc2FwUnpndTRUdkxGWmNmcm1GX05nT1NIZGhBX0dBNmpCUlNOVmFobHRfUm1FdGp6dUpxTXUyeUc2ZlFlMmZZcnliQ1NVb1FHMG01SzlpSVVnaDhJOXYyYUdMX0lCX1E?oc=5,"Fri, 02 May 2025 03:28:00 GMT","Nvidia's (NVDA) shares are not fully pricing in all of its upbeat catalysts, and it's ""certainly a buy,"" Keybanc analyst John Vinh told Yahoo Finance recently.

Moreover, it's ""a bit premature"" to be concerned about Nvidia's competition from custom AI chip makers, Vinh believes.

NVDA's Attractive Valuation

NVDA stock is failing to price in ""everything,"" Vinh said. And with the shares changing hands at less than 20 times analysts' average estimates, the name is trading for far less than its historical price-earnings ratios of 35 to 40 times, Vinh noted.

""Premature"" to Worry About Competition From Custom Chips

Since we're in the ""very early stages of generative AI,"" neither NVDA nor customer AI chip makers are going to capture the entire AI chip market, Vinh noted.

Further, NVDA ""is very far ahead of the competition,"" while there is ""limited"" validation of the custom chips made by Broadcom (AVGO), Vinh noted. AVGO is seen as a leader of the custom chip space.

But aside from Alphabet (GOOG), which uses AVGO's custom chip, there is ""limited proof"" that AVGO's processors can successfully compete with those of NVDA, the analyst reported.

Export Controls Are ""A Little Bit of an Overhang"" on NVDA Stock

Export controls on NVDA's chips are ""a concern and a little bit of an overhang on"" NVDA stock, the analyst stated. ""We'll have to see how it plays out,"" he added.

While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other Billionaire Chase Coleman’s stocks with huge upside potential.

Equity markets achieved an unprecedented winning streak over the past two years at the back of an artificial intelligence-driven run. Major US indices were on a roll, soaring to record highs as investors tailored their investments to opportunities around the revolutionary technology. Chase Coleman is one hedge fund manager who benefited from the impressive run by investing his hedge fund’s money in some of the top-performing AI stocks.

Founded by Coleman in 2001, Tiger Global Management LLC was one of the best-performing hedge funds after gaining 24% in 2024. The impressive return came on the billionaire investor betting on some of the biggest companies with significant exposure to artificial intelligence.

Fast forward, Coleman is one of the most significant casualties of the broader stock market correction. With the S&P 500 pulling back by about 6% and tech-heavy Nasdaq down by about 8%, the billionaire investor has felt the full brunt of the artificial intelligence-driven run cooling off. A good number of Tiger Global Management stock holdings have shed more than 10% in market value as the overall stock market correction gathers steam.

While up to 20% pullbacks might rattle most investors, billionaire Investor Coleman’s strategy focuses on long-term investing. Consequently, he is never perturbed by short-term market corrections. Coleman continues to maintain significant holdings in tech giants on expectations the segment will continue growing amid the artificial intelligence boom.

“Think about it in terms of companies investing in these technologies, and how well they use it,” he said, giving the example of Amazon using ChatGPT to facilitate shopping. “It’s going to be gradual. Be patient.”

Our Methodology

We combed Tiger Group Management LLC SEC Q4 2024 13F filings to identify Billionaire Chase Coleman’s 10 Stocks with Huge Upside Potential. We focused on stocks that have pulled back significantly and therefore command significant upside potential. We then analyzed the stocks on why they stand out, as solid value investments. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their upside potential."

Export controls on shipments of Nvidia's chips to foreign countries, the potential fallout of the tariff-fueled trade war, and concerns that spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure could slow down are all reasons this once high-flying chipmaker has been underperforming in 2025. However, recent developments suggest that it is on course to maintain its healthy pace of growth.

In this article, we will take a closer look at the factors that could help Nvidia defy Wall Street's expectations and send the stock soaring when it releases its fiscal 2026 first-quarter results on May 28.

These developments suggest that AI chip demand remains healthy

The data center business produces a massive chunk of Nvidia's revenue, with the segment accounting for 88% of the company's top line in fiscal 2025 (which ended on Feb. 26). So, the health of this business plays a central role in determining Nvidia's financial performance. The good part is that the recent quarterly results from its semiconductor peers suggest that the demand for AI-focused data center chips remains strong.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.68%), popularly known as TSMC, released its first-quarter 2025 results in April and said that it expects revenue from sales of AI chips to double this year. Nvidia gets its chips manufactured by TSMC, and the latter points out that it hasn't seen any change in customers' behavior despite the tariff-related uncertainty.

Moreover, TSMC reiterated its 2025 capital expenditure guidance of $38 billion to $42 billion. The company points out that it will spend 70% of that budget on advanced process technologies that will help it meet the strong demand for AI chips. Also, it is expecting a slight acceleration in revenue growth in the current quarter, and that bodes well for Nvidia since it is one of the largest customers of the Taiwan-based foundry giant.

And semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplier Lam Research also delivered impressive results recently that beat expectations. The company had strong guidance that was well ahead of expectations, signaling an improvement in growth from the robust demand for AI chips. What's more, Lam is anticipating its top line to increase by around 63% over the next four years, suggesting that it expects the favorable demand to continue.

Blackwell is set to drive solid growth for Nvidia

The concerns about a potential drop in AI infrastructure spending may be overblown, as evident from the recent news from key cloud service providers. Alphabet, for instance, says that it became the first cloud provider to offer Nvidia's latest Blackwell processors. Moreover, the Google parent has reaffirmed its $75 billion capital expenditure forecast for 2025, which would be an increase of 43% from last year, as it looks to shore up its AI capabilities by investing in the latest hardware.

Oracle has started deploying Nvidia's Blackwell processors as well to power its cloud infrastructure and meet the growing demand for reasoning models and agentic AI applications. The company intends to build Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Superclusters that will be equipped with more than 100,000 Blackwell graphics cards.

And the GPU leader is on track to win big from the $500 billion Project Stargate, led by OpenAI and SoftBank. Nvidia is expected to supply 400,000 of its AI chips for the first Stargate data center. It sells the base variant of its Blackwell B200 chip for $30,000 to $40,000 apiece, so it could witness a massive boost in its business as the Stargate Project is scaled up to its full size of 10 AI data centers.

In all, it looks like the demand for Blackwell processors that Nvidia started selling in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, generating $11 billion in revenue, is set to move the needle in a bigger way for the company when it releases its results on May 28.

Management has called for $43 billion in revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, a jump of 65% from the prior year. The ramp-up in production of advanced AI chips by its foundry partner TSMC along with the deployment of the Blackwell chips by major cloud service providers suggest that it could indeed meet or even exceed its expectations.

An earnings beat along with better-than-expected guidance could turn out to be the much-needed catalyst for Nvidia stock, and the company seems ready to deliver on both fronts based on the points discussed above. That's why buying this AI stock before its upcoming earnings report could turn out to be a smart move considering that it trades at an attractive 25 times forward earnings right now."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks.

Discussing two decades of Mad Money, Jim Cramer took a moment to highlight the top-performing stocks since the show’s debut.

“This week we're celebrating the show's 20th anniversary, a little over a month late, but better late than never. Given that Mad Money’s been on the air for more than two decades now, I think it's worth going over the best-performing stocks during that period.”

READ ALSO Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 9 Stocks and Jim Cramer Commented on These 8 Stocks Recently

He pointed out that while the broader markets have posted impressive long-term gains, the Dow rising 272%, the S&P 500 climbing 358%, and the Nasdaq 100 soaring 1,182%, the show’s philosophy has not changed. He said, ""I created this show because I believe you can beat the averages by doing the homework and picking great individual stocks."" Two decades later, he feels even more strongly about that belief. According to him, investing in high-quality companies with long-term potential can outperform those indices.

“So, looking at every US-listed stock with a market cap of at least $1 billion and putting aside everything that came public after March 14th, 2005, the day of our first show, what are the biggest winners since Mad Money first went on the air? I've gotta tell you what, I love this list.”

He also said the results were unexpected and would surprise viewers. Cramer framed these companies as real-world evidence of the show's long-held thesis, that investors who commit to studying individual businesses and hold onto strong performers over time can generate significant returns. Cramer noted that since Mad Money's launch in March 2005, “These winners really represent the core thesis of the show that you can make a killing by picking the right stocks, doing the homework and sticking with the great ones.”

“Bottom line: When you look at the 10 best-performing stocks of the last 20-odd years, so many of these were gettable if you simply believed in your ability to pick stocks and stuck with them for the long haul.”

For this article, we compiled a list of 20 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episodes of Mad Money aired on April 28 and 29. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.

We compiled the tech equities with upside potential higher than 27% at the time of writing this article and discussed why they stood out as sound potential investments. Finally, we ranked the stocks based on the ascending order of their upside potential. To assist readers with more context, we mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock using data from 1,009 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Signs of a potential rebound appeared later in April, as major indexes recovered modestly on April 24, with tech shares helping lead the rally. Investors responded positively to reports that the U.S. and China had resumed trade talks, despite earlier denials from Beijing. Trump’s announcement that some tariffs might be rolled back helped ease immediate fears, although uncertainty remains high. Analysts noted that the recent tech selloff had left the market oversold, setting the stage for short-term gains. However, mixed earnings reports and rising costs across industries continue to fuel caution, reinforcing the unpredictable nature of trade policy’s impact on tech and broader equity markets.

Despite the recent turmoil, broader optimism about technology and growth stocks remains underpinned by longer-term trends. Notably, Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management has emphasized that while mega-cap tech firms often face headwinds, they tend to outperform during bullish cycles and reflect broader market confidence. He argues that 2024’s rally was more expansive than many recognize, with tech and communication services stocks leading growth across the board. While tech stocks often decline more in bearish periods, their historical track record of resilience and growth during recoveries continues to make them attractive for long-term investors. This underscores why, even amid significant volatility, tech stocks retain strategic value for portfolios, particularly when the market regains momentum.

Technology stocks have faced heightened volatility in 2025, with market sentiment swinging sharply in response to President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies. On April 3, tech shares endured their worst day since the COVID-19 pandemic as Trump announced sweeping tariffs on all imported goods, including a 34% duty on Chinese imports, exacerbating fears of a global trade war. An iPhone maker led the steep declines among the ""Magnificent Seven,"" plummeting over 9% due to its reliance on Chinese manufacturing. Other tech giants also fell between 8% and 9%, while semiconductor and PC companies recorded double-digit losses. The tech-heavy NASDAQ tumbled 6%, marking its worst session over five years and deepening its year-to-date loss to more than 14%.

We recently published an article titled Billionaire Ken Fisher's 10 Technology Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other technology stocks.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 223

Fisher Asset Management’s Equity Stake: Million

Upside Potential as of April 30: 53.27%

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a global leader in GPU-accelerated computing, continues to revolutionize the tech industry with its high-performance graphics processing units, powering innovations across gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive sectors.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported a record-breaking revenue of $39.3 billion, demonstrating a staggering 78% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per diluted share climbed to $0.89, reflecting strong operational performance and expanding demand for NVIDIA’s AI and data center technologies.

At the same time, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) finds itself at the heart of escalating US-China tensions over advanced technology exports, particularly as Washington tightens restrictions on the sale of AI chips to Chinese firms. In response to new U.S. Commerce Department rules, NVIDIA must now obtain export licenses for its H20 AI chip, a model originally designed to comply with earlier export controls. Despite the setback, NVIDIA remains a pivotal player in the generative AI race, with its chips underpinning platforms such as ChatGPT. The restrictions are part of a broader U.S. strategy to curb China's access to advanced AI technology, while simultaneously boosting domestic chip production—evidenced by NVIDIA’s recent $500 billion AI server investment plan in the U.S., and TSMC’s additional $100 billion investment in its Arizona facilities.

To safeguard its interests in China, which accounted for 13% of its total sales last year, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang recently visited Beijing, where he met with senior officials and business leaders, including DeepSeek’s founder. Huang reaffirmed the company’s commitment to the Chinese market, emphasizing continued collaboration despite geopolitical headwinds. The visit coincided with increased scrutiny of the global semiconductor supply chain and a growing divide between U.S.- and China-led tech ecosystems.

Nonetheless, investor sentiment surrounding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains strong. The stock holds a price target of $167.09, representing a projected upside of 53.27%, placing it among the huge upside potential stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher. This optimism highlights NVIDIA’s strategic importance in the future of AI and next-generation computing, reinforcing its appeal to investors who view it as a cornerstone of technological advancement in an increasingly polarized global tech landscape.

Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:

“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. Shares contributed to performance during the quarter, driven by strong demand for its data center products, especially the Hopper H200 chips, which generated double-digit billions in revenue, marking the fastest product ramp in the company’s history. Management provided fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance above analyst estimates, along with resilient operating margins supported by robust demand and limited competition. In our view, Nvidia’s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure, including advancements in inference and test-time scaling (i.e., reasoning during inference), is driving adoption among enterprises and startups, providing continued demand for its high-performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed for inference and new clusters are deployed, we believe Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on growing compute needs across AI applications.”

Overall NVDA ranks 3rd among billionaire Ken Fisher’s technology stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

Nvidia Stock (NVDA) On Red Alert as Chinese Heavyweight Huawei Unveils ‘Nuclear Level’ Rival System - TipRanks,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNbUZUcjhySzI4VTZMMVJJeVlDUW1oUnRwcHlheUpOWktrTUVIVzhKaWxuNF9VcEY5UlpjVXB6cXllYkZxM1NwN0tXSENBLW0tcDRBYlVEYW83ZlBOLWVSM2RFMDI1S0xoQTlFYkVyRHN3NFMzT0tIcFE4TGMwZHNfNWt1MnJ1M0hOcHN3NkdNSG1adnpJWkd0aFJNVUFscGhoVHVnWmJZY0dYMHY2OU5YazBpUW1FRnRrV2dqLWpJQUIzbVE?oc=5,"Wed, 16 Apr 2025 07:00:00 GMT","U.S. semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) saw its shares plummet today as Chinese rival Huawei unveiled new AI infrastructure that can rival its computing power.

Matches Nvidia

According to a report in the South China Morning Post Huawei Technologies has introduced the CloudMatrix 384 Supernode, which is being described by Huawei insiders as a “nuclear-level” product that matches Nvidia’s NVL72 system in alleviating computing bottlenecks for AI data centres.

Nvidia’s NVL72, launched last March, features a 72-graphics processing unit (GPU) NVLink domain that functions as a single, powerful GPU, enabling real-time inference for trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs) at speeds 30 times faster than previous generations.

The new Huawei system can achieve 300 petaflops of computing power at present. That compares with the 180 petaflops offered by the NVL72.

The wonderfully named petaflops is not some mop-topped band from the 60s but simply a unit which measures computing speed and floating-point operations per second.

China on the AI March

It is understood that Huawei is testing and deploying the new system in its Wuhu data centers. It is using supernodes, which have more bandwidth, storage and memory over its alternatives and can increase the training of large language models.

Nvidia’s share price was not only rattled by this development but also the restrictions placed on its H20 chips to China.

Analysts believe this will only benefit domestic chipmakers such as Huawei. “U.S. regulators are effectively pushing Nvidia’s Chinese customers toward Huawei’s AI chips,” said Nori Chiou, investment director at Singapore-based White Oak Capital Partners, as reported by Reuters. “Huawei’s chip design and software capabilities are likely to advance quickly as it gains more customers and development experience.”

It is another fascinating development in the ever-evolving AI race between the U.S. and China.

Crypto and AI Are Converging — And Nvidia Stock (NVDA) Could Be the Biggest Winner - TipRanks,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNUGN1QjdBVmVCNVdKeDBzX3Y1Vm8wakNVMUJCTXlJb3h4SV9OaGNzSFhJTFRETl9fU25iMzJ0Z2p4WFpRSkVrNi1qOV83VktlMmNLNl96SnJ3TW1uZUpja19iVmQyVEMwQUN1QnZRZGJTQWRveVdlSWY3cWMzTzdDc0FfYXlqRnRaRTlKYmp4M2h1OGZhc0M4a0JOYmRrcnNfR2hkekxBdlBxd1pa?oc=5,"Thu, 01 May 2025 15:09:45 GMT","The next crypto cycle might not be led by altcoins or NFTs. It might be led by silicon. As AI and crypto increasingly overlap, Nvidia (NVDA) — the undisputed king of GPUs — is sitting in the sweet spot, powering both revolutions from behind the scenes.

AI needs compute. Crypto needs compute. And Nvidia sells the one thing both sides can’t get enough of.

Nvidia Supplies the Engines for Both Worlds

Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are purpose-built for massive parallel processing — the kind required to train AI models and validate blockchain transactions. In AI, those chips train large language models like ChatGPT. In crypto, they hash and process decentralized networks.

This isn’t theoretical. Microsoft (MSFT) is throwing $80 billion at AI infrastructure this year. Meta hiked its forecast to $72 billion. Nearly all of it flows into GPU-intensive data centers. That’s Nvidia territory.

As Nvidia CFO Colette Kress put it, demand for AI infrastructure is “outpacing supply.” Crypto just adds fuel to that fire.

Bitcoin Miners Are Quietly Turning into AI Landlords

Post-halving, Bitcoin mining is less profitable. But the infrastructure — racks of GPUs, cheap power, and cooling — still has value. Miners are now flipping those assets into AI compute hubs.

Case in point: Core Scientific (CORZ) signed a $4.7 billion deal with CoreWeave to lease out GPU capacity for AI. That turns what was once a crypto-only asset base into dual-use gold — and keeps Nvidia hardware in rotation either way.

Crypto Is building decentralized AI on-chain

Meanwhile, tokens like Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol are betting that AI won’t live on Big Tech servers forever. They’re building decentralized platforms where AI models, training data, and compute are distributed and open — powered by blockchain.

If that thesis plays out, it creates demand for on-chain inference, decentralized GPUs, and permissionless AI access — all powered by hardware Nvidia still dominates.

Nvidia stock is up around 35% over the past year, but the next big catalyst comes May 28, when the company reports earnings. Wall Street expects another blowout quarter — but expectations are sky-high.

Is NVDA Stock a Buy or Sell?

Wall Street isn’t backing off. Nvidia holds a “Strong Buy” consensus based on 41 analyst ratings, with 35 Buys, 5 Holds, and just 1 Sell, according to TipRanks. The average NVDA price target is $165.22, implying a 45.5% upside from its current price of $113.55.

The range is wide. High-end estimates hit $200, while the lone bear at Seaport Global sees downside to $100 — a rare Sell rating amid overwhelming optimism.

Among bulls, Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein reiterated his Buy with a $185 price target, saying Nvidia still has a long runway in AI infrastructure — a view echoed by Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar, who maintained a $150 target and noted strong hyperscaler demand.

Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore nudged his target slightly from $162 to $160, but kept a Buy, suggesting Nvidia’s strength is already well priced but still stable heading into the May 28 earnings.

Today’s fresh commentary reflects confidence following Microsoft’s (MSFT) and Meta’s (META) massive AI capex hikes this week — $80B and $72B respectively. Nvidia is still expected to be the biggest beneficiary of that spend.

The takeaway? Even after an 80%+ YTD run, top analysts still see room to run. And with Q1 earnings around the corner, Nvidia is about to be tested.

Apple and Microsoft are the world's two most valuable companies as measured by market cap.

After losing nearly $1 trillion in market value, Nvidia now trails Apple and Microsoft.

Nvidia has a lot of tailwinds that could fuel growth throughout the remainder of the year -- helping the company win back investor confidence.

For the last two and a half years, the technology sector has witnessed an abnormal level of interest compared to other industries. By no stretch of the imagination, this dynamic is connected to unrelenting euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).

What's interesting, however, is that the AI theme can largely be traced to a small concentration of megacap stocks. Known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla are some of the most widely held stocks in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) right now.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

As of May 1, Nvidia is the third-largest company in the world as measured by market cap -- sitting behind just Apple and Microsoft. Let's explore some of the factors that have influenced Nvidia's valuation throughout 2025. More importantly, I'll detail what catalysts could fuel Nvidia to become the most valuable company in the world by year-end.

Why is Nvidia stock plummeting?

It's been a tumultuous year for Nvidia. As of this writing, the stock has plummeted by 15% -- more than triple the declines seen in the S&P 500.

To quantify just how much value Nvidia has lost, consider the company's current market cap is nearly $1 trillion lower than peak levels seen in January.

The first large-scale sell-off in Nvidia stock happened earlier this year, after a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek emerged out of nowhere. DeepSeek claimed that it built an AI platform on par with many leading models built here in the U.S., but was able to do so by using older Nvidia architectures.

For a brief period, investors started to question what demand would look like for Nvidia's next-generation chipsets. After several weeks of investigative reporting from Wall Street analysts and technology journalists, it began to emerge that there was likely more to DeepSeek's initial assertions.

The current sell-off in Nvidia revolves around a nasty storm related to new tariff policies. More specifically, ongoing tension between the U.S. and China has some investors seriously worrying about Nvidia's potential in the Chinese market as it now battles a much tougher landscape featuring capable competition from Huawei."

Clients Switching to Huawei

According to an article in the Financial Times, Huawei has started delivering its advanced AI chip “cluster” to Chinese clients who have upped orders in the wake of Washington-imposed restrictions on the exports of Nvidia’s H20 chips.

The article stated that Huawei had sold over 10 sets of its CloudMatrix 384, which links a large sum of chips together. Indeed, they connect 384 AI processors in order to provide the computing power to develop AI models and services.

It is reported that deliveries have been made to data centers that serve Chinese tech companies.

“The development of Huawei’s CloudMatrix 384 means China now has an AI system capable of beating Nvidia’s,” said Dylan Patel, founder of chip consultancy SemiAnalysis, as reported by the FT.

Huawei Claims Outperformance

Huawei has told customers that its CloudMatrix performs significantly better than Nvidia’s NVL72, which consists of 72 GB200 chips. It has claimed that it has outperformed NVL72 in key metrics, saying it was 67% higher in compute and more than three times larger in aggregate memory capacity.

Despite the challenges brought on by the growth of Huawei, export restrictions and the deepening trade tensions between China and the U.S. over tariffs, Nvidia remains committed to delivering to and working with China.

Its chief executive Jensen Huang recently visited China and declared that it would deepen its presence in the Chinese market. It has even been reported – though denied by Nvidia – that it is considering setting up a joint venture in China.

Is NVDA a Good Stock to Buy Now?

On TipRanks, NVDA has a Strong Buy consensus based on 35 Buy and 5 Hold ratings. Its highest price target is $200. NVDA stock’s consensus price target is $167.09 implying an 53.27% upside.

Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the latest signs of de-escalation in trade wars between the US and China and told investors that even bear market rallies could be a positive sign. Cramer, however, believes the US government has yet to give any clarity on its policies on China.

“There’s a great misunderstanding about how real recoveries get started. They always start as bear market rallies, for heaven’s sake. They’re rarely based on hard facts. When you get this kind of rally, it doesn’t happen because someone gave you the green light to start buying. You don’t get a statement from the president that the trade war is over and everything’s back to normal.”

In addition to positive reports on the US-China tariff front, Cramer also mentioned the latest reports on President Trump’s stance on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, saying that the possibility of Trump firing the central bank chief seems to be “off the table.”

“There’s plenty of sense that something’s going to happen that’s going to take this away. In fact, just because of what we saw the other day with it going to 10 percent, I don’t see that at all.

“When do the Chinese back down? Right now they’re not, but I don’t know. I think the Chinese have been ready for this since first Trump. I think that they are ready for tariffs. I think they’re going to build coalitions worldwide. I do not think they’re paper tigers. I think that they’re a strong country and they’re ready. They’re ready for the fight.

The latest market data shows that the US economy contracted at an annualized rate of 0.3% during the first quarter of 2025. This was a rapid reversal from the 2.4% growth in the last quarter of 2024. The further segregation of the data shows that tariff uncertainty was one of the key contributing factors toward the slowdown, as net exports dropped 4.8%. According to a recent report by CNBC, traders highlighted that the imports were skewed up 41% last quarter as a preparatory move by companies to get ahead of the tariff situation. In this backdrop, the NASDAQ slipped another 0.09% on May 1, to end at 17,446.34.

On April 30, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee joined CNBC to talk about the outlook of the stock market amidst the tariff situation. He noted that the stock market is currently trying to figure out the trajectory of the economy as it is clear that the economic data for the next 3 quarters will be polluted by the tariffs and other distortions that follow. Lee highlighted that there are two questions that the market is trying to figure out. The first question is whether this is a dip and noise for 2025 only and the market exists in better shape as 2026 approaches. If this is the case then Lee believes that Equities have already made their lows with the S&P 500 at 4,835 on April 7. This will be the better-case scenario of all the possible outcomes. However, if the market feels that the uncertainty is dragging into a few more quarters in 2025 then that could be harmful for the stock market.

CNBC’s Steve Liesman added to Tom Lee’s comments by mentioning that the current stock market is the President’s market. He highlighted that when President Trump took charge the stock market rallied, however, the later policies hampered the sentiment and took the stock market down with it. Liseman further elaborated that before all these policy uncertainties the forecasts for GDP in 2025 were at 2% growth each quarter. However, now the first quarter ended up at -0.3% with an expectation of 1.6% growth next quarter.

Investors are desperately looking for signs of a market bottom after going through massive volatility and losses. 3Fourteen Research’s Warren Pies said in a latest program on CNBC that we are getting “close” to a market bottom based on his technical analysis. The analyst talked about key indicators he’s looking for:

“I do think that the White House is trying to deescalate the situation. One of the markers we’ve seen is that Peter Navarro hasn’t been on TV since April 13th, and that’s corresponding with this equity rally. Setting that aside, though, I think that a bottom, a confirmed bottom, has two components. You need to see washed out sentiment and positioning. We measured that in a number of ways: we measured it in inverse ETFs for retail, we measured it for vault targeting for institutions, and CTAs for trend followers. Across all those metrics, sentiment is depressed. That’s phase one of a bottom. Then, you look for technical confirmation. Philosophically, we’re always going to be late because of that ordering.”

Link suggested that NVDA would rebound significantly over the longer term, and she noted that she had been buying more shares of one of NVDA's rivals, Broadcom (AVGO).

NVIDIA (NVDA) Still a Strong AI Bet Amid Market Volatility, Says Bernstein

Link Suggests That Nvidia's Valuation Is Attractive for Long-Term Investors

Nvidia is changing hands for 20 times analysts' average forward estimates, Link noted. And although analysts' estimates will likely drop 8% to 9% due to writedowns that the firm preannounced today, historically the shares' forward price-earnings ratio has not dropped below 23 times, the investor stated.

Nvidia is ""not out of the woods, but it is a high-quality company, and it's the number one in the industry,"" said Link, adding that the shares have dropped a great deal and ""there is a price for everything.""

The investor concluded her remarks on NVDA by saying that ""When the dust settles, people go back to the number one or two in any industry.""

Why Link Bought More AVGO Stock

""I like the diversity of Broadcom,"" the investor explained. She noted that Nvidia, unlike Broadcom, is ""a pure play on AI.""

While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other growth stocks to buy for the next 3 years.

On April 29, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities joined ‘Power Lunch’ on CNBC to discuss his outlook for the tech sector and expressed that tariffs aren’t stopping the AI revolution. According to Ives, the critical question for the sector was whether spending, particularly CapEx, was being maintained. He expressed confidence that CapEx was holding up and predicted that the forthcoming results from big tech companies would serve more as a confidence booster for the market, rather than fueling the existing fears. As some investors are of the idea that concerns about a potential soft patch in the economy remain, there’s a preference for safer investments in insurance and other stable sectors, rather than big tech. However, Ives acknowledged that while uncertainty had been prevalent in recent weeks, his own survey work and field research indicate that AI-related spending stays strong. He noted that, while there were areas of the cloud sector where spending was accelerating, the overall uncertainty would likely result in broad guidance ranges from companies.

Michael Darda, the Managing Director, Chief Economist, and Macrostrategist at ROTH, also believes that AI would generate solid returns in the future. Ives agreed with Darda’s assessment and stated that enterprises were seeing similar advancements and could not afford to leave their AI projects behind without the risk of consequently falling behind. He also pointed out that for companies like those in the MAG7, the AI revolution is a central theme, which is why challenges brought forward by tariffs would not impact the AI revolution as much. Darda changed his outlook from bearish to bullish on tech and AI recently due to his personal experience with AI tools, which he felt had improved over the past year.

Dan Ives reiterated that, despite the uncertainty created by tariffs, the demand for software remained a safety blanket, and spending by hyperscale companies is expected to continue.

"Nvidia (NVDA) Advances, AMD Eyes Gains: Ruben Roy Sets the Stage Ahead of Earnings - TipRanks",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQNXI5Wkw3anRZb29wVzg3Wkw3QjFqQ1NSd0Q5UXE4eUFIYUkyNWNQWWE2RFNqbkVYZkRNTGFSVGZtLW5RQ2RhdkhfYkQwMHpuSzAzTjNDOTYzcVpqdGxCejVuZlZJbkZ3Zlp0QTQzUGJhTnJmY2I5UHVZclBXQXc5aTRyWnZSWkZrN0JnSkxSSHQwS3dLMGVVTmdSUTV1TUg5ZjA1YWhEQ2lPUDE2?oc=5,"Fri, 02 May 2025 15:43:47 GMT","The first-quarter earnings season is in full swing, and the results are painting a nuanced picture. About 36% of S&P 500 companies have reported, and while 73% have delivered upside surprises on EPS, that’s a touch below the 5-year average of 77%. Still, the size of the beats is impressive. The average earnings surprise clocks in at 10%, outpacing the 5-year norm of 8.8%.

These numbers haven’t gone unnoticed. Stifel’s 5-star analyst Ruben Roy, who is rated by TipRanks among the top 4% of his peers, sees signs of cautious optimism taking shape. He’s especially focused on the tech sector, which he believes could hold the key to upside potential as more earnings roll in.

“Following the initial wave of C1Q earnings, results and outlook across our group and adjacencies have largely fared better than expected, particularly for companies that have exposure to hyperscaler/AI spend. Our discussions with investors, though, suggest continued concerns regarding the broader demand implications as trade talks continue… While we think there is still potential for some downside risk across the board, we believe selective opportunities in certain segments, such as in Processors and Optical/Networking, look more attractive as tactical entries, amidst the current set up,” Roy opined.

The current set up will see two chip giants, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), report their next quarterly results in the coming weeks, and Roy believes that both companies are well-positioned to weather a tariff storm and bring long-term gains. Let’s take a look at both companies to see the overall Wall Street take in conjunction with Roy’s comments.

Nvidia

Nvidia has long been a leader in the chip industry, and its proven expertise with GPUs gave it a step up when the AI boom started at the end of 2022. The company’s global footprint, however, left it vulnerable to the impact of the recent turmoil over tariffs, and shares in NVDA are down 15% so far this year. That said, the company still boasts a market cap of $2.8 trillion, ranking it as the third-largest publicly traded firm on Wall Street.

That strength was on full display on April 28, when Nvidia announced that Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has deployed thousands of its Blackwell GPUs. These chips will boost Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s ability to provide low-latency performance, and will be tasked with developing and running next-generation agentic AI and reasoning models.

In addition to its continued success as a provider of cutting-edge semiconductors, Nvidia is also building a position for itself in the next generation of computing technology. The company announced in March that it is building a leading-edge research and development center in Boston, to focus on new advances in quantum computing. Specifically, the research center will work on accelerated quantum supercomputing, derived from the integration of leading quantum hardware with AI-powered supercomputers.

On the financial front, Nvidia’s momentum is unmistakable. For fiscal Q4 2025 (ending January 26), the company pulled in $39.3 billion in revenue, a 78% jump from the year before, and $1.19 billion above expectations. Non-GAAP EPS came in at 89 cents, topping estimates by 4 cents. The data center segment, the engine behind its AI surge, generated $35.6 billion, up 93% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, Nvidia’s revenue soared 114%, reaching an $130.5 billion.

Nvidia is scheduled to release its fiscal 1Q26 results on May 28, and the Street is expecting to see revenues of approximately $43 billion.

While there are headwinds facing the tech sector, including ongoing uncertainties about tariffs and interest rates, analyst Ruben Roy believes that continued strong demand should provide support for Nvidia.

“Our recent supply chain discussions indicate that demand visibility extends well into 2H2025 with Blackwell Ultra appearing well positioned to accelerate through year-end and into 2026… We think tariff decisions, trade regulations (most recently tied to the banning of H20 sales in China resulting in a $5.5bn inventory charge this upcoming quarter) and Fed interest rate uncertainties will weigh on returns in the near-term, which likely bring estimates down some post-earnings, but… a lot of that action seems to be preemptively priced in. There is still some downside risk to the stock but we think it is far less than the opportunity for upside at current levels (i.e. current levels are still well off historic lows in terms of annual returns),” Roy opined.

Roy’s stance here backs up his Buy rating on Nvidia’s stock, and his price target of $180 implies a 57% upside potential for the shares in this coming year. (To watch Roy’s track record, click here)

Like its ‘Magnificent 7’ peers, Nvidia has picked up a lot of attention from the Street, in the form of 41 recent analyst reviews. These break down to 35 Buys and 5 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently trading at $114.75 and their $165.22 average target price suggests that a gain of 44% lies ahead. (See NVDA stock forecast)

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

While AMD may not share Nvidia’s mega-cap status, it still ranks as the world’s seventh-largest chipmaker. The company first made its mark as a powerhouse in the PC market, earning a solid reputation for crafting high-performance processors tailored to everyday consumers. In recent years, however, AMD has been pushing into new territory, expanding its footprint in both gaming and data centers. At first glance, these markets may seem worlds apart, but they share a crucial common thread: both rely on cutting-edge, high-capacity processors – technology that AMD is increasingly leveraging to tap into the booming demand for AI computing.

Earlier this year, AMD released several new products targeting the AI market. These include new AI chips in the Ryzen line, which are designed to run AI apps on consumer or small business PCs, combining AMD’s ambition with its known strength. Additionally, AMD has recently announced that its 5th-gen EPYC processors are in use with Google Cloud’s new C4D and H4D virtual machines.

AMD isn’t just releasing new products to power its moves into AI. The company is also moving to acquire new capabilities. In March of this year, AMD completed just such an acquisition, of ZT Systems. ZT specialized in providing AI and general-purpose computer infrastructure for major hyperscalers on the global scene. By acquiring the company, AMD can add its new AI-capable GPUs and CPUs into a large-scale mix with AI and cloud computing applications.

The last set of earnings AMD released covered 4Q24, and in that quarter the company showed a top line of $7.7 billion. This figure was a company record, beat the forecast by $170 million, and was up 24% from 4Q23. AMD’s earnings total, reported as $1.09 per share in non-GAAP measures, was about as expected. As noted, the company had total revenues of $25.8 billion for all of 2024.

Looking ahead, we’ll see AMD’s 1Q25 results on May 6. The revenue estimate currently stands at $7.11 billion.

Ruben Roy, in his notes on AMD, points out that this company is likely to continue showing strong revenue performance despite a potential ‘tariff war.’ He writes, “In spite of tariff-driven macroeconomic uncertainty (coupled with an uncertain export restriction outlook) we believe that AMD will reaffirm this F2025 GPU revenue curve; while tariffs remain uncertain, recent commentary from the Trump administration indicates a potential US-China deal on the horizon, and strong customer engagements point to a persistent demand environment for AMD AI.”

Getting into the specifics of AMD’s prospects, Roy adds, “We think AMD stands to gain meaningful market share within the compute infrastructure and processors sub-sector over the coming years, particularly as they close the innovation gap with NVDA via their open-source platforms. We are not expecting a meaningful upward revision of estimates post-earnings and, if anything, believe we’ll see sell-side estimates moderate. However, we think much of the downside for AMD is largely baked-in, with more limited room to drop on returns relative to historic lows versus upside potential over the longer-term.”

To this end, the Stifel tech expert puts a Buy rating on AMD shares, and backs that up with a $132 price target, implying a one-year potential gain of 33%.

Overall, AMD has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 35 recent analyst reviews that include 23 Buys and 12 Holds. The shares are priced at $99 and the $138.19 average price target suggests that the stock will gain ~40% this year. (See AMD stock forecast)

Is Now the Time to Buy Beaten-Down AI Stocks? - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE1jXzBLak9PalhEamUxM18xcWQ3Y0RDTUVFVHQ5Nk1WMXRJbUEwQWZxbUFRTWp5MDE5UW9oNzQ1ZTljMmJTd21leVJpTTZmMktiVEZxWnNZZWNCRGFBSW5TSG9IQ244aENibzJBbDdTdVhaWVhqbFplOW13?oc=5,"Sun, 04 May 2025 19:15:00 GMT","Key Points

AI stocks led gains last year, but concerns about President Trump's tariffs on imports have weighed on them this year.

More news on tariffs could be just ahead, impacting share price movement in the near term.

Investors rushed to get in on artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past two years as it became clear that AI might be the next big thing. The idea was that this newish technology could join the ranks of electricity or the internet, revolutionizing our daily lives and a whole lot more. As a result, companies such as AI chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and AI-driven software company Palantir Technologies saw their stock prices soar -- these two surged 171% and 340%, respectively, last year.

But recently, the excitement has turned to concern about what's ahead. Early last month, President Donald Trump announced a detailed plan for tariffs on imports, and stocks -- particularly tech and AI players -- sank.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

Though the president paused the tariffs for a 90-day negotiation period and even temporarily halted tariffs on electronics products, the issue remains a risk for U.S. companies. The concern is that the tariffs will result in higher prices, hurting both the U.S. consumer and companies, particularly those, such as tech players, that heavily import parts and finished products.

Amid these fears, the Nasdaq Composite crashed into bear territory. Though it's recovered from its low point, many AI stocks remain down for the year. And many are trading at reasonable and even bargain valuations. Does this mean now is the time to buy beaten-down AI stocks? Let's find out.

Today's tariff situation

So, first, let's consider the tariff situation. At the moment, tech companies don't face tariffs because Trump has exempted them. This means U.S. tech players don't have to pay the 145% tariff that Trump imposed on China when importing electronics items from that country. (The U.S. excluded China from its pause on tariffs.)

The Trump administration is now studying what level might be appropriate for electronics and will soon announce a tariff that will apply specifically to imported electronics parts and finished products. Meanwhile, companies are making an effort to reorganize their manufacturing processes to minimize potential tariff impact.

For example, Nvidia announced a major move to build AI infrastructure in the U.S., and Apple said it's moving production of its iPhones and other products for the U.S. away from China -- the country most impacted by Trump's tariffs -- to India and Vietnam."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other most profitable blue chip stocks to buy now.

Blue chip stocks are large, financially stable companies with strong market presence, consistent profitability, and regular dividend payments. They are generally market leaders, with strong business models that are resilient across business cycles. Many blue chip stocks are included in the Dow Index (DJIA), so the index is often considered an indicator of their overall performance. Investors would typically flock to blue chip stocks in times of market volatility, economic uncertainty, or when the economy is in late-stage expansion, as these large-cap companies tend to offer stability and consistent returns versus smaller or riskier companies.

We believe that blue chip stocks, and the constituents of the Dow index in particular, represent a unique blend of the value and size factors, combining the financial stability, earnings consistency, and attractive market valuations typically associated with value stocks, with the scale and market dominance of large-cap companies. This dual exposure enhances their resilience in economic downturns and makes them well-positioned to outperform during recessions, when investors tend to shift towards quality and safer stocks. For reference, the Fama–French Three-Factor Model, introduced in 1993, concludes that incorporating exposure to several favorable factors can further enhance stock returns. In this context, both the value and large size factors outperformed in the last years, and especially year-to-date.

Our research indicates that recession fears and Trump Turmoil are likely to persist and potentially continue to favor the most profitable blue chip stocks over everything else. The US administration appears to be eroding the trust of investors through a plethora of unpredictable and contradictory moves – Trump appeared to soften his stance on the US-China trade war, saying that tariffs on Chinese goods “will not be as high as 145 per cent” and that “it’ll come down substantially, but won’t be zero”. While this represents a good signal at first glance, such actions are very likely to deter the US’s partners from negotiating for tariff exemption, simply because the current administration has become too unpredictable.

Our thoughts are confirmed by the VIX volatility index remaining elevated compared to the long-term trend, while the crude oil price remains in a downtrend, suggesting expectations of weaker industrial demand and a weaker economy. On the consumer side, there are reasons to believe that US consumers are getting more cautious than ever – the employee quits rate, as reported by FRED, declined substantially year-to-date and reached levels comparable to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. When employees are reluctant to quit it means two things: (1) it is tough to get jobs out there, implying that the economy is slowing down, and (2) their expectation about the future becomes more pessimistic, which leads to less willingness to quit and potentially risk difficulties finding a new job. Both these factors mean the consumer spending will likely slow down in the following quarters, further pressuring GDP growth."

The US stock market is still more than 10% below its all-time high as market participants are still digesting the tariffs situation as well as the new economic data, which is quite disappointing. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index decreased to -26.4 in April, well below expectations and the lowest reading since April 2023. It is also the second lowest level outside of official recessions, which hints towards the possibility that we are already in a recession that will only be declared at a later date. The employment, shipments, and new orders components all decreased as well, further pointing towards a slowing economy.

While the growth strategy delivers superior returns most of the time, we believe there are ways to refine it and make it more reliable. One of the weaknesses of most growth stocks is weak profitability (due to aggressive investments in working capital for growth or R&D), which makes them more susceptible to economic downturns. The solution to this is to incorporate a profitability criterion as well – growth stocks with strong profitability will navigate economic slowdowns better and hold up well even during recessions. Our hypothesis is confirmed by modern financial research; the Fama-French 5-Factor Model (2015) introduced a profitability factor which, as the authors claim, can explain stock returns – stocks of companies with high profitability tend to outperform those with low profitability.

The growth factor in investing refers to companies that grow their revenue and earnings at rates significantly above the market. These companies are usually small and young, operate in high-growth and less mature industries, and often lack the financial stability and resilience of their more mature counterparts. As a result, the growth factor becomes highly attractive and outperforms during secular bull markets (such as the 2010-2021 period) dominated by macroeconomic stability and low interest rates. On the other hand, the return of growth stocks significantly lags behind during bear markets or periods of heightened uncertainty and volatility. For reference, the growth factor underperformed significantly during the 2022 bear market as well as the 2025 year-to-date.

Story Continues

Business surveys have also been quite grim – Hamilton Lane recently reported that at least 62% of CEOs see a recession on the horizon, while the 6-month Capex expectations fell to the lowest level since the pandemic. It is now clear that pretty much everyone is thinking about a recession now, and that’s actually the most bullish indicator out there. The stock market is a forward-looking animal, meaning that its prices reflect the state of the economy 6-12 months from now. Given that the average recession in the US has historically lasted for about 3-4 quarters, and assuming that revised Q1 2025 data will be later recognized as the beginning of the recession, odds are that the US economy will already return to growth in calendar 2026. Also, history shows that the forward-looking stock market tends to disappoint the majority of investors, which means that if the majority expects a recession, then odds are that it is already priced in and that the market bottom is already in the rear-view mirror.

To sum up, the fact that the US economy is in a slowdown and a state of uncertainty is pretty much obvious at this point. The key takeaway for readers is that stock prices are forward-looking and reflect the investors’ outlook for several quarters ahead. Once it becomes completely clear that calendar 2026 will be past the current tariff turmoil, the US stock market will very likely return to growth. It is therefore an opportune moment to look for the most profitable growth stocks to add in anticipation of a broad market melt-up.

Demand for the AI chips and systems remains extremely strong as customers race to build out AI infrastructure. NVDA successfully ramped production of its new Blackwell architecture, delivering $11 billion in Blackwell revenue in Q4 despite some initial delays.

Looking ahead, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects continued strong growth in fiscal 2026, forecasting Q1 revenue of $43 billion. The company sees multiple drivers of AI compute demand, including pre-training of larger multimodal models, post-training techniques like reinforcement learning, and inference scaling for reasoning AI that can require 100x more compute per task. The company is positioning itself to address the full spectrum of AI workloads from cloud to enterprise with its Blackwell platform. While gross margins are expected to dip initially with the Blackwell ramp, management expects them to recover to the mid-70% range later in the fiscal year as manufacturing efficiencies improve.

Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of most profitable blue chip stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks on analysts’ radar amid tariff turbulence.

Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, predicted in a CNBC program earlier this month that unlike previous market crashes, the latest market volatility of 2025 could see a quick resolution because it was “self-inflicted.”

“Unlike prior drawdowns that you’ve seen, like the global financial crisis, you’re not going to fix the problem in a day because you’ve accumulated tons of bad mortgages. You’re not going to fix COVID because it’s a global pandemic in a day. You’re not going to fix the tech bubble meltdown because you overinvested for 5 years back in the late 1990s. This you can literally fix overnight if everybody, you know, resettles the tariffs because this is a self-inflicted wound.”

However, this does not mean Niles is bullish on the market in the long term. He still has valuation concerns and reiterated that he entered the year with cash as his biggest holding. Niles said his top five picks do not include any of the Mag. 7 companies, and he would remain cautious on valuations:

Asked about his preferences in the current market environment, the analyst warned investors to steer clear of high valuations and big promises that lie far into the future:

“I would focus on is which companies are generating a lot of cash, which ones tend to pick up market share during recessions. Those are the types of names that you want to be in because if you’re in stuff where, well, you know 10 years from now it’s going to be a big market, you’re going to get absolutely murdered if you get into a recession,” Niles said.

Joshua Brown, the co-founder and CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, said in a latest program on CNBC that while he’s long Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), he believes a slowdown in AI chips demand could impact the stock long term. He believes companies have been ordering Nvidia chips with the money they raised from wealth management firms and that chain of investments could break in case demand slows down."

Founded in 1993 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA has transformed from a gaming graphics company into a dominant force in AI and data center technologies.

Shares of this chip giant have outperformed the broader market over the past year. NVDA has gained 26.1% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 10.6%. However, in 2025, NVDA stock is down 18.9%, compared to $SPX’s 5.3% fall on a YTD basis.

More Top Stocks Daily:

Zooming in further, NVDA has surpassed the S&P Semiconductor SPDR’s (XSD) 14.1% drop over the past year and 22.3% decline this year.

NVIDIA has underperformed the broader market in 2025, due to a combination of high investor expectations, geopolitical risks, and increased competition. While the company continues to post strong earnings, its results have not significantly exceeded forecasts, leading to investor disappointment. U.S. export restrictions on AI chips to China have also hurt NVIDIA’s revenue prospects, alongside rising competition from firms like Huawei.

On Apr. 30, NVDA shares fell 2.5% amid broader market weakness and concerns over economic data and key customer performance. U.S. GDP unexpectedly declined 0.3% in Q1, and consumer spending also slowed, pressuring tech valuations. Adding to Nvidia's challenges, major customer Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) slashed its Q3 revenue and earnings guidance, citing delayed customer platform decisions. This raised fears of softening demand for Nvidia’s AI chips.

For the current fiscal year, ending in January 2026, analysts expect NVDA’s EPS to grow 36.9% to $4.01 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.

Among the 42 analysts covering NVDA stock, the consensus is a “Strong Buy.” That’s based on 37 “Strong Buy” ratings, two “Moderate Buys,” and four “Holds.”

This configuration has remained fairly stable over the past months.

On Apr. 25, Morgan Stanley (MS) lowered its price target on Nvidia to $160 from $162 but maintained an “Overweight” rating, citing strong GPU demand driven by a global shortage of inference chips for large language models. Despite macro and supply chain concerns, the firm dismissed the idea of an AI slowdown, noting rapid growth in demand.

The mean price target of $166.10 represents a 52.5% premium to NVDA’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $220 suggests an upside potential of 102%.

Latest reports from the IMF reveal that economic gains from artificial intelligence are likely to outweigh the costs of rising carbon emissions from the data centers needed to run AI models. The report, released at the IMF’s annual spring meeting in Washington, revealed how artificial intelligence is going to boost global output by around 0.5% a year between 2025 and 2030. At the same time, it also noted how these output gains will not be shared equally worldwide.

""Despite challenges related to higher electricity prices and greenhouse gas emissions, the gains to global GDP from AI are likely to outweigh the cost of the additional emissions. The social cost of these extra emissions is minor compared with the expected economic gains from AI, yet it still adds to the worrisome buildup of emissions”.

Considering that energy policies remain the same and artificial intelligence use becomes widespread, greenhouse gas emissions will see a cumulative global increase of 1.2% between 2025 and 2030. However, a switch to greener energy policies would limit the increase to 1.3 Gt.

Quantifying the social cost of these emissions, the report calculated that the extra cost is likely to be at $50.7-$66.3 billion, which is smaller than the income gains that can help boost the economy by 0.5% each year through AI.

According to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, AI may even be able to generate an overall reduction in carbon emissions if it accelerates advances in low-carbon technologies in the power, food, and transport sectors.

""But market forces alone are unlikely to successfully drive AI's application toward climate action. Governments, tech companies and energy companies must play an active role in ensuring AI is used intentionally, equitably and sustainably.”

Seaport Research hitting Nvidia with the rare sell rating, as it initiates coverage on semiconductors. Seaport noting AI is bringing about a secular shift in the industry. Jay Goldberg, senior analyst at Seaport Research partners joining us now to discuss this. Jay, it is great to have you here. So you're initiating Nvidia with a sell, uh, you might, Jay, per Bloomberg be the only sell on, on the street. Explain the rating, rating to us, Jay.

00:27 Jay Goldberg

Great. Great. Uh, thanks for having me. So, put simply, I think the AI story, we've been talking about it for years. We all know about it. It's fully priced into Nvidia right now. They're a good company, they make great products, but they've said already their newest line of products, their Blackwell line is sold out for the year. They're capacity constrained. Once you're sold out, the, the, the room for upside is, is pretty minimal, the bias shifts towards the downside, right? There's not much they can do to get above where consensus is, but there are a lot of things that can trip them up. There's lots of small things, snafus. There's a lot of friction in the system. And I think that uh, we should be concerned about those and that, you know, I, semiconductors are cyclical, and it's important to remember that.

01:37 Speaker A

Um, Jay, um, what about this idea that there might be some sort of potential tariff or export control relief for Nvidia, um, that wouldn't necessarily affect Blackwell, but could affect some of its other chips?

02:02 Jay Goldberg

Well, I, I think that there's two sides of this tariff story for Nvidia. One is their cost of importing things from China. A lot of their supply chain comes from Asia. Most of the analysis we've seen shows that that impact is fairly minimal. So that the, the hyperscalers, the Googles and the Amazons of the world can continue to buy Nvidia chips and import them into the country, essentially, you know, no, no tariff or very low tariff. The flip side of that is what's going on in China. China would very much like to get their hands on more Nvidia chips, um, but that seems very increasingly difficult in this geopolitical environment. So it's less about tariffs and more about this perceived rivalry between the US and China's AI race. Uh, and I, I, I don't see that lightning up anytime soon. And even if it does happen, uh, you know, it's, it's still fairly minimal. I think we'll still, there will still be some restrictions, so it won't be a, a, a quick snapback.

03:41 Speaker A

Jay, you know, on the big tech companies that have reported since on CAPEX, Jay, I mean, and you've watched obviously, I mean, you saw Alphabet reiterate, Microsoft reiterate, uh, Meta actually raised. Uh, that would seem to be all good news for Nvidia, Jay. So I guess you're saying yes, it is good news, but that, that simply is priced in at these levels.

04:19 Jay Goldberg

That's right. It's priced in for these levels. And I think it's important to remember what they're talking about is CAPEX for this year. It's a little early to be talking about CAPEX budgets for next year, but in my conversations I'm having with everybody is there's a growing scrutiny being applied to AI spend. We've had some really, really big numbers this year from all the hyperscalers. I think it's, we're starting to see signs that, you know, I don't think anyone's gonna cut drastically, but there are certainly signs that the finance team is starting to ask questions. A year ago, it was all AI all the time, but now the, the CFO has entered the chat and is starting to ask like, what, what's the return on this investment? And just to be clear, I'm a believer in AI. I think there's a lot of potential there. I just think it's going to take us a few years as an industry to really find those compelling use cases. And as we do that, there's going to be, you know, a sort of gravity asserting itself and people are going to ask what's the return on this investment? And I think that is, that, that sets us up for potential for a pause, at least a slowing.

05:58 Speaker A

Jay, even as you have the sell on Nvidia, do you have a buy on Broadcom? And of course Broadcom has gotten a lot of attention as being, um, a company that could benefit from more companies sort of doing custom chips or contract made chips. Um, but when you talk about stuff being priced in, I mean, Broadcom is up about 60% over the last year, Nvidia is up about 36% or so. So how much of that outlook is priced in?

06:39 Jay Goldberg

So I, I think this, what I told my sales forces is that the AI story is fully priced into Nvidia and it's not priced into Broadcom. Broadcom has a lot of other pieces going on there beyond the AI story, their networking business, their software business. But I don't think the street entirely believes their AI story. And we actually saw this. They reported earnings in December and for the first time they laid out their opportunity for AI. And it was large. It was a massive opportunity. Anytime Nvidia loses share today, it's to one of the hyperscalers doing their own chip and Broadcom makes a lot of money helping them bring those chips to market, right? So when they laid out their AI story, Broadcom was up 20, 25% on that, right? And then in January, we saw the deep seek story come out and everyone had a momentary panic that we weren't gonna need GPUs anymore. Uh, and Broadcom essentially gave up all those gains, right? And I think, I think there's still a lot of show me built into the Broadcom story around AI. And you know, the street doesn't believe it, I do.

08:21 Speaker A

Jay, thanks a lot. Appreciate it.

08:26 Jay Goldberg

Thank you."

Market uncertainty aside, the AI race is tighter than ever. A report by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) states that not only has the battlefield become tighter, but also more crowded than previously. The report notes that Google and OpenAI are neck to neck in the race to build cutting-edge AI, and that other companies are fiercely closing in. Meta, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI are a few of these names. Chinese competitors are also closing in on the AI race. In particular, DeepSeek’s R1 model is very close to the top-performing models of two of the leading AI companies.

“It creates an exciting space. It’s good that these models are not all developed by five guys in Silicon Valley. Chinese models are catching up as far as performance to the US models..but across the globe, there are new players emerging in the space.”

In recent news, OpenAI has launched its new AI model GPT-4.1, along with smaller versions GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-4.1 nano. These models boast major improvements in coding, instruction following, and long context comprehension.

According to OpenAI, the models outperform the company’s most advanced GPT-4o model across the board and are available only on OpenAI’s application programming interface (API). In particular, the GPT-4.1 brags a 21% improvement over GPT-4o and 27% over GPT-4.5 on coding. Moreover, there are improvements in instruction following and long context comprehension, which make these models a better choice for powering AI agents.

“Benchmarks are strong, but we focused on real-world utility, and developers seem very happy.”

OpenAI also noted that these models operate at a “much lower cost” compared to GPT-4.5, and that the company would turn off the GPT-4.5 preview that is available in the API in July because the new models offer “improved or similar performance.”

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks making waves today.

China’s foreign ministry recently released a video on its social media feeds, complete with a voice-over in American-accented English, comparing the acceptance of U.S. President Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs to “drinking poison”.

“China won’t kneel down, because we know standing up for ourselves keeps the possibility of cooperation alive, while compromise snuffs it out… Imperialists are always arrogant. If they show a bit of reason it’s only because they are forced to do so”

A Chinese official revealed that Beijing believes yielding or compromising now would only weaken China in the future and that it would authorize Trump to change the terms later. These ongoing tariff riots aren’t superficial, rather, they are a reflection of deeper tensions in the ongoing US-China rivalry, particularly over dominance in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.

In the initial days of the tariff frenzy, former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland had called on President Donald Trump to take the threat of tariffs off the table. She argued that the U.S. will need Canadian energy in the race to achieve dominance in artificial intelligence.

Freeland has deemed the tariffs as “the dumbest trade war in history,” stating how the U.S.-Canada trade relationship is largely balanced when oil, gas, and electricity are excluded. She said that the tariff threat needs to be taken “definitively off the table.”

“You are really lucky that Canada is the country that sells you oil and gas and electricity. We are a much more reliable supplier than, say, Venezuela. And the fact is, particularly with AI, America’s needs for energy are only going to increase.”

Canada aside, the artificial intelligence boom is being slowed due to the overall global trade war triggered by the Trump administration. Upcoming earnings reports from tech giants and utilities powering the massive data centers will reveal whether tit-for-tat tariffs, particularly between the U.S. and China, are making businesses change their plans for building data centers and other infrastructure.

China plays an important role in the production of AI hardware. It was excluded from a 90-day tariff reprieve earlier. According to analysts, the 145% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will sharply increase data center costs if an exemption on electronics is rolled back."

What Happened: Microsoft beat analyst estimates for the third quarter on the top and bottom lines, driven by strong Azure and cloud services growth.

Total Microsoft cloud revenue came in at $42.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Azure and other cloud services revenue increased 33% year-over-year, suggesting that the company’s heavy AI investments are paying off.

“Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft.

Meta also reported strong quarterly results after the bell and raised its full-year capital expenditures outlook to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion, up from prior guidance of $60 to $65 billion. The company attributed the higher forecast to increased AI investments, reassuring investors that the AI trade is still alive.

Nvidia is leading a pack of AI-related names higher after the bell as investor sentiment surrounding AI names appears to have gotten a boost from the mega-cap reports. Both Microsoft and Meta are significant players in AI and cloud computing, which appears to have reinforced confidence in the sector.

Nvidia scheduled its first-quarter financial results after the close on Wednesday. The company is now set to report earnings after the market close on May 28.

Analysts are anticipating earnings of 88 cents per share on revenue of $43.07 billion, according to estimates from Benzinga Pro.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.

Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about President Donald Trump’s attack on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and said he was expecting this to happen “weeks ago.” Cramer said that he “likes” Powell and thinks the central bank chief is now in a difficult situation. Cramer thinks it’d be “illegal” for Trump to fire Powell.

“The Federal Reserve never cuts rates when inflation’s out of control, which it very well could be once the tariffs are all in. I think the Fed chief wants to find out if that’s going to happen. I like Powell, you know that. I think he’s generally done a good job, a good public servant. Unfortunately, right now, he’s stuck between a rock and a hard place. Now, history says he should be doing exactly what he’s doing, but history is now in the eye of the beholder, and there’s only one beholder in this whole country, and it ain’t J. Powell.”

Cramer said that tariffs will result in higher prices, and that will in turn make the central bank’s job difficult because it cannot cut rates when prices are going up.

Nvidia given a rare cell rating. Seaport research initiating coverage on the stock with a bearish call, as it highlights that upside appears to be fully understood and largely priced into the stock. So, Seaport here initiating coverage really on the semis. This is kind of a broader note, but they do include here a sell on Nvidia. Uh and among their reasons, they told their clients, AI priced in for now, they say. They talk about how its prospects are well understood, largely priced in. They talk about mounting questions as to the utility of AI. They also call out competition. They say, from Nvidia's customers, they see strong momentum behind the cloud giants' internal Nvidia alternatives.

What's so striking about this is, this is the only sell

Mhm.

on Nvidia from Wall Street. I believe it is the only one. There are some hold ratings, but there aren't really any other sell ratings. So, this is really a standi-, yep, there you go. 70 buys, nine holds, only one sell. So this really stands out, um, in terms of its commentary and that it's not just going to a hold, it is going to a sell. As we know, we don't get Nvidia earnings until later than the rest of the group, about a month from now. Uh we did hear from Super Micro Computer which came out, um, with some preliminary results that were weak. And so, there are some assuming read-through that the the market is assuming, at least, from those results.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks under $100 to buy according to hedge funds.

On April 21, Chris Davis of Davis Advisors appeared on ‘The Exchange’ on CNBC to talk about selectivity in today’s market. Davis pointed out that putting companies in groups like the MAG7 covers their underlying businesses, which can have different fundamentals and therefore prospects. For this reason, he acknowledged that he owns certain stocks from MAG7 but not all. Davis also clarified that his overall focus is on value and growth, which leads him to a diverse set of holdings and not just tech, such as financials and healthcare names. He then argued that the market is shifting back toward selectivity and active management. He suggested that active management is positioned for a resurgence because the indexes have become highly concentrated and richly valued.

Davis acknowledged that while he cannot predict the market’s short-term movements, the present environment is ideal for stock pickers who can identify resilient businesses that are trading at reasonable valuations. He sees this as an opportunity for active management to outperform, as investors move away from momentum-driven index investing toward a more selective approach. He noted the growing popularity of actively managed ETFs as evidence that investors are beginning to act on this shift away from index concentration. He also believes that within the MAG7, only a few companies are truly well-positioned. Similarly, within the S&P 500, only 5% to 10% of companies possess the resiliency and durability needed for such volatile times.

Davis laid out what he sees as the major transitions shaping the current investment environment. First, he described the shift from nearly 15 years of free money to a more normal interest rate environment. Second, he pointed to the end of a multi-decade era of globalization, which was replaced by deglobalization, rising nationalism, and geopolitical tensions. Third, he highlighted the impact of AI. He said that these transitions are occurring against a backdrop of market complacency, with high valuations and concentrated growth expectations.

Aswath Damodaran from NYU Stern School of Business said in a latest interview with CNBC that while investors are “celebrating” positive results of a few major tech companies, the problems haunting these firms will take a while to show up in their results. However, Damodaran, also known as ‘Dean of Valuation,’ said it won’t be prudent to “give up” entirely on Mag. 7 companies.

“They can consolidate their advantage. In a weird way, again, all these troubles might play into the hands of the Mag 7, because the more troubles there are, the more flexibility gets rewarded. And as you pointed out, these companies are incredibly flexible, incredibly adaptable. We saw that with COVID, we saw that in 2022 with inflation, and I’m convinced you’re going to see it again. Doesn’t mean you load up on the Mag 7, but if you’ve never owned them, you had a chance to buy into at least one or two of them in the last month. You might have missed that chance, but the chance was there. So I wouldn’t give up that easily on the Mag 7.”

Damodaran said investors experienced a lot of “trauma” in April. He argued against reactionary investing and said that when investors respond to daily events and news cycles, they damage their portfolios.

“Maybe the best thing investors could have done is left at the start of the month, gone somewhere without internet service, and come back at the end of the month. Because everything we do is reactive, and often when you’re reacting to day-to-day events, you’re going to end up doing more damage to your portfolio than helping.”

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other billionaire Cliff Asness’ stock picks with huge upside potential.

Cliff Asness, the founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, is a well-known figure in the world of finance. Starting with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness was able to boost the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund’s assets to more than $100 million in just a handful of months. Cliff Asness’ investment strategies, which focus on value and momentum, have delivered exceptional returns for AQR, setting him apart from his fellow hedge fund managers. As a testament, the fund has produced positive returns over the last three years, with its greatest year in 2022, when it returned 43.5%.

The first quarter of 2025 continued that momentum. As Wall Street grappled with increased volatility resulting from President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff policy, AQR Capital Management outperformed the market by 9%. The firm’s Apex strategy, a $3 billion multi-strategy fund that includes equities, macro, and arbitrage trades, rose 3.4% in March, adding to its strong quarterly performance. Meanwhile, AQR’s Delphi Long-Short Equity Strategy returned 9.7%, while its trend-following Helix strategy gained 3% during the same period.

Cliff Asness has repeatedly stated that he is not an admirer of Bitcoin. In a recent CNBC interview, the hedge fund manager voiced pessimism about Bitcoin, claiming that it had no realistic use case, although he did not rule out the possibility that the leading cryptocurrency has formed a bubble. Back in February, the billionaire stated that Bitcoin and the S&P 500, were basically “the same thing” with varying amounts of volatility. Asness has also questioned the notion that Bitcoin must be seen as a store of value simply because it has a limited supply.

The billionaire seemed even more critical of the idea of a cryptocurrency reserve, a stance that sharply contrasts with President Donald Trump’s. In a piece written for The Free Press, the money manager stated his thoughts about the President’s executive order:"
Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Best Dow Stock for the Next 12 Months? - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFBiYzhNY2NmUHEwOWRCZzBaZUk2WGtlbzFsaE9iT1VJSWdxS0tFdFg2WnVHTzduZUdaVzdxc2NvWF9Hb01kZ3YzZ0NfM2MzNXU5UG41ZE82NldpTk5OMjRIa2pjUkxVXzJfUUxlNWJTSWI3ZC1MZjdGQ3FBWQ?oc=5,"Wed, 30 Apr 2025 18:25:04 GMT","We recently published a list of The Best and Worst Dow Stocks for the Next 12 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best and worst dow stocks for the next 12 months.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), or the Dow, is a price-weighted index that has long been seen as a barometer of the health of the U.S. economy. After touching all-time highs in late November 2024, the index has corrected nearly 7% in 2025 (as of April 23) and is down 12% from its highs. Rightly so, the correction reflects several unfavourable developments, including economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions weighing on economic growth. The market is expected to remain volatile as the trade and other aspects of the US administration’s policy agenda play out.

Amid this volatility, based on the potential for share price appreciation in the next 12 months, we have created a selection of the best and worst Dow stocks from the 30 Dow constituent stocks.

Has This Been the Most Volatile Period for The Dow?

If we analyse its trackable history from 1899, the Dow has fallen 7% or more on a single day twenty times. Of those, only seven occurred after the year 2000, and the 5.5% decline on April 5, 2025, doesn’t count as one of those seven, or not even in the historical top twenty. So, technically, this correction was not as severe as earlier. From corrections post 2000, the sharp declines when Covid-19 struck were the most noticeable – Dow fell 7.8%, 10%, and 12% on 9, 12, and 16th March, respectively, and saw further significant declines in that year.

That said, the current period remains one of the most confusing times for market participants, even for the larger players in the equity market, who remain uncertain about their estimates for the broader markets, such as the Dow.

Is Volatility Expected to Continue?

In a recent interview, Lauren Goodwin, Chief Market Strategist at New York Life Investments, emphasized that the fundamental picture remains cloudy and investors are still looking for clarity in macroeconomic fundamentals. Despite some positive economic data recently, policy uncertainty is limiting visibility. As more data is released, she believes markets are entering a sustained period of elevated volatility across equities and fixed income.

What is The Best Way Forward for Investors?

In these testing times, investors should examine fundamentals more critically, preferring Dow stocks with earnings resilience, clear competitive advantages, and exposure to long-term, secular growth themes. On April 28, Stephanie Link, Hightower Advisors’ chief investment strategist, shared her positive outlook on the stock market in an interview on CNBC. With major tech companies, consumer, and financial companies set to announce results, she believes that if corporate earnings remain strong, the recent market rebound could continue. Since early April, the market has recovered significantly, and she attributed the rally to better-than-expected profit margins and steady corporate performance. Although the prominent tech names aren’t cheap in terms of valuation, she views the recent declines as long-term buying opportunities."

Speaking in Washington, D.C., he emphasized that the AI race is ongoing and competitive policy, not restriction, should lead.

The U.S. government recently restricted Nvidia's shipments of its H20 AI chips to China without a license. The chip was designed to comply with earlier regulations, but Nvidia now expects a $5.5 billion revenue hit.

Huang said Huawei is one of the most formidable technology companies in the world, noting its work on domestic AI chips despite being on a U.S. trade blacklist. He said China may be right behind the U.S. and highlighted the AI competition as a long-term, infinite race.

The CEO said Nvidia aims to build AI servers in the U.S. with Foxconn, with assembly planned near Houston.

Huang's comments signal that trade restrictions may be insufficient to maintain U.S. leadership if not paired with investment in innovation. He called on U.S. policymakers to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of domestic firms.

Investors will be watching how Nvidia balances domestic production with international demand as regulatory headwinds continue.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that could 10X over the next 2 years.

US Tariffs and the Stock Market Turmoil

While tariffs from the US government disrupted international trade, they also led to uncertainty and turbulence in financial markets, with the S&P 500 closing below 5,000 points for the first time in nearly a year. An analysis from the World Economic Forum regarding how tariffs cause volatility in financial markets was stated in the words of Santiago Fernández de Lis, Head of Regulation, BBVA, as follows:

“The main impact of trade tensions on global markets is through uncertainty. When major economies—like the US and China—engage in a tariff war, investors fear slower global trade, disrupted supply chains and weakened corporate profits. This anxiety translates into market volatility. Companies delay investment decisions, consumers lose confidence, and currencies fluctuate wildly.”

However, global markets rebounded later as the US president made an announcement of a 90-day pause on additional higher tariffs that had to impact almost 80 countries, with the exception of China. In the case of China, the new president is convinced to keep high tariffs as he stated that these tariffs would be increased to 125% from 104% following China’s announcement of additional retaliatory tariffs against the US.

Following this pause in tariffs, Wall Street witnessed a sigh of relief. The S&P 500 rose 9.52%, thereby marking its biggest one-day gain since 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed almost 7.87% to close at 40,608.45. Simultaneously, the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 12.2% and had its best day since January 2001.

Guy Adami and Dan Nathan both had very negative takes on the chip giant's outlook.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Buy According to Billionaire Chris Rokos?

Adami is the Director of Advisor Advocacy at Private Advisor Group, while Nathan is the principal of RiskReversal Advisors. Why Adami Was Bearish on NVDA Although Nvidia held its low of around $90 recently, it ""continues to trade poorly, "" Adami said. ""I'd sell"" the stock,"" he concluded. Why Nathan Was Bearish on NVDA After Nvidia was prohibited from selling many chips to China by the Trump administration, Nathan believes that those unsold chips will ""create a huge inventory problem"" for NVDA. Additionally, China was supposed to be ""a huge"" growth engine for NVDA, according to the investor, who noted that China had accounted for 13% of the company's sales in 2024. Nathan predicted that NVDA stock would ultimately fall 50% below its high.

Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 5% in the morning session as stocks grappled with more uncertainty after President Trump criticized the Federal Reserve's approach to interest rate cuts, warning that the pace was slow and could hinder economic growth. Trump's comments added pressure to an already sensitive market, raising concerns about political interference in monetary policy.

Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell maintained a cautious stance the previous week, highlighting the difficulty of balancing the dual mandate of steady employment and price stability amid the escalating trade tension.

Investor sentiment was further dampened by the absence of constructive progress in trade negotiations, especially US-China relations which took a turn for the worse in the previous week.

Overall, the outlook seemed more unclear heading into the first quarter 2025 earnings season, as a combination of hard to predict monetary policy and unresolved trade tensions weighed on business confidence.

The shares closed the day at $96.80, down 4.6% from previous close.

What The Market Is Telling Us

Nvidia’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 35 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock dropped 7.4% on the news that the company announced it might be unable to sell some high-end chips (including the H20 chips) to China due to export controls and requirements from the Trump administration. Notably, Nvidia received an export restriction notice on April 9, 2025, suggesting the development was unanticipated heading into the quarter and likely not baked into its near-term sales forecast. As a result, the company planned to take a $5.5 billion charge due to inventory writedowns and canceled sales.

The H20 chips were built for China to fit within limits set during the Biden administration. China brought in more than 10% of Nvidia's sales in fiscal 2025, so the new restrictions could still weigh hard on Nvidia's growth in the near term.

On a separate note, chip tool maker ASML posted weak bookings (a key demand indicator) which fell below Wall Street's expectations, noting that tariffs had made the industry's outlook more uncertain."

Ultimate Insider Marjorie Taylor Greene’s #3 Stock Pick: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOeXRWYkNKeDhfM0R4VWRQSVQ2WmFJT1J6V1k5bVJRYVdGRHVMOEZNUlg0Snhsd21QMGtGeWxxMVZmYmNWWk1PWmRrT1AwSTVtYktVMkZ1VHF0RW5JR0pGMmNxZHl4enAyYmtJOEtSSkZuMnhsNG1Mc25CbFVOMGNDcTRwQ19KZDZiVkthVmpn?oc=5,"Wed, 23 Apr 2025 07:00:00 GMT","We recently published a list of 20 Best Stock To Buy According to Marjorie Taylor Greene. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stock to buy according to Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Marjorie Taylor Greene is one of the most active members of the Trump administration on the US stock market. Her latest disclosures show that Greene, who is the US representative for the 14th congressional district of Georgia since 2021, purchased stakes in several beaten down technology stocks in the days prior to the announcement of a 90-day pause on new Trump tariffs. Following the pause, the share prices of many of these technology stocks rallied. This trading activity has drawn the ire of social media, where users routinely highlight that lawmakers from both major parties in the US Congress should be banned from stock trading because of the apparent conflict of interest in owning shares of companies they can heavily influence with positions they can take in office. Like Greene, other US lawmakers active on the stock market, like Nancy Pelosi, are also in the spotlight following the latest bout of the US-China trade war.

Taylor Greene sits on important Congressional committees, including the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, where she is the Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE). She is also on the House Committee on Homeland Security, where she sits on the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, as well as the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability. Disclosures made by Greene through her latest transaction report reveal that the lawmaker sold between $50,000 to $100,000 worth of US Treasury Bills to fund the purchase of beaten down technology stocks just before an announcement by US President Trump that he was pausing for 90 days new tariffs that had earlier sent markets tumbling around the world. Greene is a staunch supporter of the tariffs, having said in a post on social networking platform X that tariffs were a powerful proven source of leverage to protect national interests.

For this article, we consulted Capitol Trades, a platform that tracks the stock trading activity of politicians in the United States. It is important to clarify that the stocks listed below were picked from the public record of investments Marjorie Taylor Greene has made in the past few months. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

As a result, software is currently the only area of ""safety"" in the technology sector, he stated.

Dan Ives Apple

On the other hand, though, the vast majority of AI and large cloud projects are proceeding on schedule, Ives added.

Ives Is Bearish on the Hardware Makers

After the analyst mentioned the names ""Nvidia and Apple,"" CNBC anchor David Faber broke in, saying ""You've used the word 'Armageddon' more than once.""

Ives responded, ""Because..when we're talking to the supply chain,that's what they're telling us."" He added, ""The only area we see as a safety blanket in this Category 5 storm is software.""

The Analyst's Positive Comments on AI, Software Makers

""Only 5% to 10% of AI projects and (large cloud deals) are getting delayed,"" Ives said. Calling the latter trend ""much better than expected,"" the analyst identified Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Palantir (PLTR) as likely beneficiaries of this situation.

Ives noted that he only expects to see ""slight reductions"" in spending on data centers, compared with previous, announced plans.

While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Despite the ongoing pressures, analysts are upbeat about several chip companies due to their solid execution and AI-induced demand. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we placed Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), and Broadcom (AVGO) against each other to find the best chip stock, according to Wall Street analysts.

Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)

Qualcomm, one of the major suppliers of chips for smartphones, delivered upbeat results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2025 and issued solid guidance. The company is focused on opportunities in the AI space and is seeking growth beyond smartphones in other end markets like automotive and IoT.

However, investors have been concerned about the loss of Apple (AAPL) as a key customer, with the iPhone maker shifting to in-house modems. Moreover, macro uncertainties and trade wars are also impacting QCOM stock, which is down about 4% so far in 2025.

Qualcomm is scheduled to announce Q2 FY25 results after the market closes on April 30. Analysts expect the company to report EPS of $2.82, reflecting a 15.6% year-over-year growth. Further, Qualcomm’s second-quarter revenue is estimated to rise 13% to $10.6 billion.

What Is the Target Price for QCOM Stock?

Earlier this month, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buachalter reiterated a Buy rating on QCOM stock but lowered the price target to $160 from $195. The analyst believes that widespread tariffs, regardless of exemptions for semiconductors, “add an accelerant to an already-potent mix of investor concerns on compute/AI.”

In a preview of the compute semiconductor group, the analyst stated that results are unlikely to see an impact, but outlooks of companies in his coverage may reflect notable uncertainty “pervading what is inherently a global tech supply chain.”

Ahead of QCOM’s Q2 FY25 results, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the stock based on 11 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average QCOM stock price target of $198.71 implies about 35% upside potential.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)

After enjoying a strong rally last year, Nvidia stock is down 19% year to date. Concerns about tariffs, chip restrictions, and growing competition are weighing on investor sentiment. In fact, on Monday, NVDA stock fell over 4% following a report that Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies is preparing to test an advanced AI chip amid Trump’s export ban on Nvidia’s chips to China.

Nevertheless, several analysts remain bullish on Nvidia’s prospects as they believe that the company is well positioned to gain from continued demand for its GPUs in building and training AI models. They are optimistic about the demand for the company’s Blackwell platform and focus on continued innovation.

Is NVDA a Strong Buy?

Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia stock but slightly reduced the price target to $160 from $162. The 5-star analyst stated that NVDA remains his Top Pick, thanks to “undeniably positive” GPU data points and an inference market that clearly needs GPUs across multiple hyperscalers.

Moore thinks that continued AI spend and Nvidia’s relative supply chain flexibility will help the company outperform its peers despite a higher tariff environment. In fact, the analyst raised his revenue estimate for Fiscal 2027 to $255.5 billion from $230.9 billion and adjusted EPS estimate to $6.01 from $5.37, citing sustained momentum in Nvidia’s data center segment and a sharp acceleration in inference usage.

With 35 Buys and five Holds, Nvidia stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target of $167.09 implies 53.7% upside potential.

See more NVDA analyst ratings

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)

Broadcom stock has declined about 17% so far in 2025 due to demand fears amid a potential economic slowdown. The company offers a broad range of semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions.

Despite near-term pressures, most analysts remain confident about Broadcom’s growth potential, thanks to AI-induced demand. Notably, Broadcom’s upbeat Q1 results and guidance reflected AI-led tailwinds. AVGO’s AI revenue for Q1 FY25 increased 77% year-over-year to $4.1 billion, with the company expecting it to grow to $4.4 billion in the fiscal second quarter.

Overall, Broadcom is expected to see solid growth, with strength across its semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments. The company’s $69 billion VMware acquisition, completed in November 2023, is expected to further strengthen its software business and expand its presence in the data center and cloud infrastructure space.

Is AVGO a Good Stock to Buy?

Recently, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse lowered the price target for Broadcom stock to $250 from $300 and reiterated a Buy rating. Following an investor call with AVGO’s management, the 5-star analyst stated that despite macro uncertainty around tariffs and volatility in the marketplace, Broadcom’s business outlook remains unchanged. Notably, AI demand remains strong due to the existential nature of AI investment for hyperscalers, the non-AI semiconductor business bottoming, and software business continuing to be stable.

Muse added that Broadcom remains a broadly diversified company having significant pricing power, which will likely offset any tariff headwinds. Consequently, the analyst expects AVGO’s EPS estimates to be much stickier than other semiconductor companies if volatility persists. While Broadcom remains a “TOP PICK” for Cantor Fitzgerald, the firm lowered the price target to reflect the current volatility in the market.

Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Broadcom stock based on 23 Buys and two Holds. The average AVGO stock price target of $244.50 indicates 27% upside potential.

Conclusion

Despite near-term macro pressures and tariff troubles, Wall Street remains highly bullish on Nvidia and Broadcom stocks and cautiously optimistic on Qualcomm stock. Currently, they see a higher upside potential in NVDA stock than in the other two chip stocks. Wall Street sees continued demand for Nvidia’s advanced GPUs that are needed to build and train AI models.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) a Stock That Should Double in 3 Years? - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNblRyTE5NX3lCekNnRnJ0ZUZIUlhoa3l5bUZYNGhnQXdLQ0xrcThoTGZ4NEhCX084QXJhZDdyd3pINkM2TnpyVkhCcHlERDY5UEZXbkloT1UzcXVqU3FXQWpoc1VUengwZ3lPQUhfWGxQY1liWDFYMmlVNmxtaGVYZWFsVzIzMjNpa1E?oc=5,"Wed, 30 Apr 2025 08:05:55 GMT","We recently published a list of the 30 Stocks That Should Double in 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that should double in 3 years.

On April 25, Kari Firestone, Aureus Asset Management executive chairman and co-founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the latest market trends and express how this is a reasonable place for long-term investors to enter the market. Despite persistent concerns about a recession coming from tariffs, Firestone thinks that corporate earnings have generally exceeded expectations. The strong performance of major tech companies has been a key driver behind the market’s recent gains, such as those in the MAG7. Elaborating on the significance of these tech giants, Firestone also underscored that the top 2 companies in the S&P 500, regardless of which they are, match the market value of the bottom 300 companies in the index. This concentration means that these leading firms are fundamental to the US economy’s progress.

The conversation then addressed the impact of proposed FDA budget cuts on innovation for biotech companies. Firestone agreed that such cuts could slow down the approval process for new products and drug manufacturing, and she advised against reducing the FDA’s budget. However, she believes that the market has already priced in these risks. She compared the situation to previous market overreactions, such as the 32% drop during the early COVID-19 period, which was followed by a rapid recovery.

Firestone also concluded that the market is now fairly valued. Some sectors offer attractive opportunities due to recent price declines. She assessed the overall market valuation in light of tariff uncertainties and the recent rebound from a 20% drop to a current decline of about 10.5%. She explained that the market’s price-to-earnings multiple has decreased from 22.5x next year’s earnings to 18.5x, assuming no severe recession. She’s confident that the market is unlikely to end the year lower than current levels and recommends that long-term investors enter the market at this stage. Firestone believes that the market has partially priced in the impact of tariffs. She estimated that a 5% to 10% tariff is reflected in current prices. While a full-blown recession may not be entirely priced in, a slowdown likely is.

In addition to losing a great deal of their China business, the firms have ""lost pricing power"" amid greater competition in the U.S., Guilfoyle suggested.

NVDA and AMD are currently ""in a tough spot,"" he said.

The video was posted by TheStreet.

Greater Domestic Competition

The large cloud-infrastructure players are being pressured to buy AI chips from more companies and a number of them, including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), are making their own AI processors, Guilfoyle said.

Amid these trends, there's ""pricing pressure"" on ""the designers of higher- end AI chips,"" said Guilfoyle, who previously had only mentioned two U.S.-based AI chip makers in the video: NVDA and AMD.

""I don't think they have the pricing power the way they once did,"" the investor added.

Largely Cut Off From the Chinese Market

NVDA and AMD are now not allowed to sell the previous versions of their AI chips in China, and Huawei, a China-based tech firm, is filling the void, Guilfoyle reported.

While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best growth stocks to buy according to billionaires.

Can the Stock Market Have a Big Rebound?

The stock market has been on a rollercoaster ride for the past few weeks as the sentiment has quickly shifted from post-election bullishness to being priced in for a slow-down or a recession. The volatility can be estimated by the 19% decrease in the S&P 500 from its recent all-time high. To talk about the current market volatility and the way forward, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee joined CNBC for an interview. He noted that the market is currently pessimistic as recent data shows that they have priced in a 60% probability of a recession, however, it is essential to note that if the tariff situation de-escalates then the probability of a recession isn’t that high. As a result, Lee thinks that there is a big window of opportunity for stocks to rebound, however, this rebound is contingent on the path of tariff de-escalation.

While addressing the concerns that if the market is in a bear market, Lee noted that if we define a bear market by stocks grinding and losing money, then this has been happening since December 2024. However, if you define a bear market as unleashing a type of financial tightening that leads to a recession, the current market does not fit that criteria. Lee acknowledged that it does feel like a bear market for an average person.

Lee also talked about the viable investor strategy under the current circumstances. Firstly, he highlighted that people are fighting two brains at the moment, one is a tactical brain, where people want to know if this is the bottom and be convinced by seeing the stocks rally on bad news. On the other hand, there is the investor or the long-term brain, which suggests that people should have confidence in the US companies to navigate this volatility. Lee noted that he is a buyer of this volatility as he thinks that the de-escalation of tariffs will take place, which will result in a big rebound for stocks.

Our Methodology

To compile a list of the 10 best growth stocks to buy according to billionaires, we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Insider Monkey’s Billionaire database. Using the screener we aggregated a list of growth stocks that have grown their top-line by more than 30% over the past 3 years and sorted them by market cap. Next, we cross-checked each stock’s sales growth from Seeking Alpha and ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of billionaire investors.

The AI Diffusion Rule, established under former President Joe Biden, is set to take effect May 15. The policy restricts exports of advanced AI chips and model weights to nations including China.

Anthropic claimed in a blog post that Chinese smugglers had hidden chips inside prosthetic baby bumps and among live lobsters. Nvidia dismissed the allegations and said U.S. firms should focus on innovation instead of manipulating regulators. CEO Jensen Huang also said during a Washington, D.C. visit that China is not behind in AI and praised Huawei's capabilities.

Anthropic relies on Nvidia's hardware to train models. Its proposal for tighter export rules could curb Nvidia's overseas revenue. The firm argues that access to computing power is a national security chokepoint.

The escalating disagreement between two major AI stakeholders signals a growing divide in U.S. tech policy as President Donald Trump considers further tightening export rules.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks investors are monitoring after tariff shock.

The tariff wars and a potential slowdown in AI spending threw water on investors’ AI trade plans and outlook. However, many analysts believe the broader outlook of the industry is still strong.

Ben Bajarin, Creative Strategies CEO, in a latest program on CNBC explained why he is still bullish on the Jensen Huang-led AI giant:

“I think when you look at the technology roadmap … in terms of what they’re doing with Grace Blackwell and Blackwell systems going forward, it’s going to be very, very hard for others to compete. I think they were extremely bullish about how much of the industry—not just the traditional, you know, cloud servers but AI factories and this entirely new infrastructure—and how it is being kind of redeveloped for the AI era. Like, it’s not being built on other things. And so I think when you look at the ecosystem that’s grown around them, they’re deeply entrenched. It doesn’t have any sign of that changing.”

Bajarin said that he sensed “frustration” in Jensen Huang’s tone as the executive feels Wall Street is not modeling the growth potential his company’s AI products truely have.

“And he seems to think that nobody is modeling that in or really understands it. So there’s the—we kind of have a sense of what they’ll sell just product-wise here in 2025, which is where I agree with you. Hard to surprise to the upside to move the stock, but I think he is signaling people don’t understand the magnitude of this opportunity. And I think that’s worth unpacking because there is a lot of growth ahead.”

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street’s attention.

In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the company’s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution.

OpenAI claims that Musk has tried “nonstop” to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using “bad-faith tactics” against it to help him control AI technology.

Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a “for-profit” company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity.

OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion.

“Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,”

In response, Musk’s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. Following two years of gains exceeding 25%, the markets welcomed the new year with considerable volatility and a sharp decline. In the first quarter, Ithaka’s portfolio underperformed the R1000G by 30 basis points, recording -10.3% to -10.0% (gross of fees) amid a negative market environment.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute, and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was -1.29%, and its shares gained 25.84% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On April 28, 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $108.73 per share with a market capitalization of $2.653 trillion.

Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:

""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the undisputed leader in accelerated computing, with dominant market share in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) powering AI workloads across data centers, edge devices, and emerging platforms. Its end-to-end ecosystem—from silicon to software (CUDA, networking, and AI frameworks)—creates high switching costs and a widening competitive moat. With secular demand for AI infrastructure still in its early innings, Nvidia stands to benefit from sustained topline growth and strong operating leverage. In early January, a little known Chinese AI company, DeepSeek, released its large language model (LLM), DeepSeek-R1, to an unexpecting world. This model was purportedly trained on very few high-end Nvidia chips and was highly efficient when compared to other leading models. This release set off a chain reaction where investors have had to grapple with the idea that the world may not need as many GPUs as previously thought, which hampered the Nvidia buy case and sent the P/E multiple down to its cheapest level in the past 5 years.""

Watch These Nvidia Price Levels as Stock Slips on News of Chinese Rival's AI Chip - Investopedia,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxOVWwyMVYtRXRCZ3NRUWlRYS1ZYUI4Um1vTFNTWGIzaUs5Y0hmZ1RwZGI0Qld0VnlXQW9XOGQzMGQyOGdoTURHQ3V5NVNwb09CcWxqXzJORXo3MGF1RXVyV1A2Wkdna1ZTaGFvb0wySU9PVzQ2TEZrR25VSG1BN0ZWM1k5SG9EWlo5dGFENS0yN0VndFlwb1VLSVhRRkxFSVBnVXR5dFNETzJRQnh1MXlWSC1iSE5MNVJi?oc=5,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 02:06:27 GMT","Key Takeaways Nvidia shares fell on Monday to snap a four-day winning streak following news that China's Huawei Technologies is developing a rival AI chip.

The stock has pushed up against the upper trendline of a falling wedge pattern, potentially paving the way for a bullish breakout.

Investors should watch key overhead areas on Nvidia's chart around $115 and $130, while also monitoring crucial support levels near $96 and $87.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell on Monday to snap a four-day winning streak following news that China's Huawei Technologies is developing a rival AI chip.

The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the Chinese company hopes the new chip could replace some of Nvidia’s high performance products, adding that it has approached several Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the chip.

Nvidia shares are up about 25% from their early-April low but have lost around a fifth of their value since the start of the year as of Monday’s close. In recent months the AI favorite's stock has come under pressure due to concerns over significantly cheaper AI technology coming out of China and a federal crackdown on the export of the company’s popular H20 chips to China.

Below, we take a closer look at Nvidia’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for.

Falling Wedge in Focus

Nvidia shares continue to oscillate within a falling wedge after a bear trap emerged on the chart earlier this month, a trading event that lures investors to sell upon a breach of major support—the pattern’s lower trendline in this case—before the price makes a sudden move higher.

More recently, the price has pushed up against the pattern’s upper trendline, potentially paving the way for a bullish breakout. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) has crossed back above the 50 threshold, indicating improving price momentum.

Let’s identify two key overhead areas on Nvidia’s chart that could come into play and also locate crucial support levels worth monitoring.

Key Overhead Areas to Watch

A breakout above the falling wedge pattern’s upper trendline could initially see the shares test the $115 level. This area may provide overhead resistance near the April swing high, a location that also aligns with several retracements on the chart stretching back to last September.

Buying above this area may trigger a move up to around $130. Investors who have bought shares at lower prices could look for exit points in this region near last year’s prominent August peak and December trough. Interestingly, this location also sits just below a bars pattern projected upside target that takes the stock’s move higher following a prior bear trap on the chart and overlays it from this month’s low.

Crucial Support Levels Worth Monitoring

A move lower could lead to a retest of support at $96. Investors may look for buying opportunities at this level near last week’s swing low and two notable peaks that formed on the chart in March last year.

Finally, a decisive breakdown below the falling wedge pattern's lower trendline could see Nvidia shares revisit lower support around $87. This area on the chart may provide support near the bear trap low and lines up with a range of price action between March and May last year.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Worst-Performing Blue Chip Stock So Far in 2025? - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPWk9YSjRYcUdiTnNyVGlQVHNCLWRMT3NqZm1PVG8tNHVrREtKdzUzeW5JMXVhaFVRb0ZxUjdXMkwyQjB0Qlk4MlJ5OHd1UDB4Yi0ycEZjWlp6emFUVVJJT3VSNUw2NmdOX24tVU9EWlo1ci12c2NHOEJQcHZNc191Q2ZLUDctZUJzU1J3YmVmUQ?oc=5,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 14:16:50 GMT","According to analysts at research firm Citi, President Donald Trump’s tariff push could plunge the U.S. economy into a recession. In return, chip stocks could plunge by over 20% as they remain the most susceptible.

Likewise, blue chip stocks exploded on the artificial intelligence-driven run amid growing expectations of multibillion-dollar opportunities around revolutionary technologies. Fast forward, interest rate cut expectations have faded, and investors have started questioning opportunities around AI. The development of low-cost AI models is one factor that has significantly affected sentiments in the semiconductor sector, triggering a recalibration of the long-term outlook.

Similarly, the prospects of the US Federal Reserve sticking with high interest rates to try and tame inflationary pressure from getting out of hand amid the trade war is another major headwind taking a toll on large-cap companies. Last year, the stocks exploded on expectations that the Central Bank would cut interest rates on inflation, dropping to acceptable levels.

While blue-chip stocks come from well-known, established companies with a strong performance history, they are the most susceptible to changes in trade policies and tariffs. That’s because their business operations span various borders. This might explain why the stocks come under pressure every time the US imposes tariffs, followed by retaliatory measures from other nations.

“The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe…this is not what we voted for,” wrote Bill Ackman, the billionaire head of Pershing Square, on X. “The President has an opportunity on Monday to call a timeout and have the time to execute on fixing an unfair tariff system. Alternatively, we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter and should start hunkering down.”

The selloff has come on trading volumes reaching levels not seen in 18 years; investors are increasingly exiting positions. As the US implements sweeping tariffs and China retaliates, fears of a global trade war and recession concerns continue to dent the market outlook.

Blue chip stocks are under immense pressure amid the evolving trade tensions and tariff announcements around the globe. The stocks are down by more than 15%, with some plummeting into bearish territory on shedding more than 20% in market value year to date.

We recently published a list of 11 Worst-Performing Blue Chip Stocks So Far in 2025 . In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other worst-performing blue chip stocks so far in 2025.

Story Continues

“We believe the biggest risk to the semi sector is a recession resulting from tariffs,” Chris Danely, a managing director at the bank, wrote to clients in a recent note. “If the tariffs continue for another month, we believe is it highly likely the supply chain will ‘freeze up’ given uncertainty, drastically lower order rates/inventory, and result in lower guidance across the board – similar to Covid.”

On the other hand, semiconductor stocks are not the only ones under pressure amid the escalating trade wars. Energy, industrials, and healthcare stocks are also feeling the brunt, resulting in some of the worst-performing blue chip stocks so far in 2025.

Our Methodology

To prepare this article, we began by listing all the holdings of the various blue chip ETFs like E.A. Bridgeway Blue Chip ETF and Vanguard Mega Cap ETF, among others. We then sourced the year-to-date share price returns for each company and selected the worst performers, as of April 25. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q4 2024. The stocks are ranked in descending order of their year-to-date performance.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Worst-Performing Blue Chip Stock So Far in 2025?

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Year To Date Share Price Return as of April 25: -19.74%

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs and supplies graphic processing units for high-performance computing in data centres, computers and gaming consoles. It is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence-driven rally, having exploded to become a trillion-dollar company over the past two years. While the stock has posted double-digit percentage gains over the past two years, it is under immense pressure in 2025.

The deep pullback has come from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) being caught in the middle of an escalating trade war between China and the US. Consequently, the company says it will take a hit of $5.5 billion on the US placing restrictions on the export of its H20 artificial intelligence chips specifically designed for the Chinese market.

The H20 chip has less computing power than the more powerful AI chips banned in China. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) confirmed that it will require a special license to export the chip to China, a market that accounted for 13% of its sales last year and continues to send jitters in the market. Amid the restrictions, HSBC has downgraded the stock to a Hold from a Buy, concerned that the chipmaker’s pricing strength in the AI GPU market is fading.

Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of worst-performing blue chip stocks so far in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

"‘Don’t Miss the Next Leg Higher,’ Says Investor About Nvidia Stock - TipRanks",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNZWkwNnROcWgzaFl0MUdvQTVlTzJxV2U5Y1JUaFdsTXNvVmNPazlmb0FvSnNaU2dGM1NlbnJZVXd6Y20ya0lUWGRPcVR4ek84QUtvRVV1akRHWVRUcVZ0cTBjbjBHUldQMjROZlFqSWRmUHh6ZjFveWl4RXNqOWxoZXFxSF9FZ2FSQU5la01GSEdSaWVRdlQw?oc=5,"Fri, 02 May 2025 00:09:31 GMT","Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock might have been a major AI play over the past few years, but recent times have proven more challenging for the chip giant. The stock is down 17% year-to-date, pressured by a mix of macro factors (such as China tariffs) and company-specific headwinds (e.g., concerns that huge growth is slowing, the rise of DeepSeek, and issues with the Blackwell ramp-up).

Still, for investor Kevin George, the selloff marks more of a setup than a setback. After holding a bearish stance, he now views the pullback as a “stable market correction,” one that opens the door for investors to catch the “next leg higher.”

Part of George’s renewed optimism stems from shifting winds in the geopolitical arena. After rattling markets with sweeping tariffs, Trump now appears to be easing off the throttle, a shift that George believes reduces risk and could restore confidence across the chip sector.

While global tariffs have been lowered to a flat 10%, the latest rumors suggest a 50% – 60% tariff specifically on Chinese goods (down from the current up to 145%).

Additionally, following earlier setbacks with the Blackwell series, Nvidia has had time to sort out the issues with the new product.

The company has also mitigated some offshoring risks by initiating U.S.-based supercomputer manufacturing. Production of Blackwell chips is now underway at TSMC’s facility in Phoenix, Arizona, and Nvidia is constructing supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, which are expected to reach capacity within 12 to 15 months.

Furthermore, Nvidia recently unveiled its GeForce RTX™ 5060 GPU lineup. Set to hit the market in April and May, the new series will introduce Blackwell architecture and enhanced rendering capabilities to gamers, starting at a price point of $299. “This could open additional revenue for the company over the coming quarters,” George points out.

Even the $5.5 billion write-down related to the China H20 restrictions can be seen in a favorable light. It is a result of being at the “forefront of the artificial intelligence arms race,” but it’s a setback Nvidia can likely absorb in the upcoming quarters.

“Despite the recent headwinds,” George sums up, “Nvidia is on a strong fiscal path, with a growing cash pile that is being reinvested into shareholder returns and AI equity bets.”

Accordingly, George has upgraded his NVDA rating from Sell to Buy. (To watch George’s track record, click here)

It’s mostly Buys amongst the analyst community on Wall Street too; the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on a mix of 35 Buys, 5 Holds and a single Sell. At $165.22, the average price target factors in a one-year gain of 48%. (See NVDA stock forecast)

GTC Recap and Beyond: 10 AI Stocks on Investor's Radar

In light of these points, Mogharabi suggested that investors ""wait for things to settle and (to) get more clarity about geopolitical issues"" before buying NVDA stock.

Geopolitical Difficulties

Due to restrictions on the chips that NVDA can sell to China, incentives are being created for China to invest more money in developing its own AI chips, Mogharabi asserted. This situation ""does not necessarily help Nvidia,"" he stated.

Stepped-Up Competition

Nvidia's competition is ""growing very, very quickly,"" with the large cloud-infrastructure companies making their own AI chips, the investor stated. Another tough competitor is China's Huawei which has developed semiconductors that are ""pretty comparable to Nvidia's (new) Blackwell 200"" chips, according to Mogharabi.

The Recent Price Action of NVDA Stock

In the last month, the shares have fallen 18%, while they are down 30% in the last three months.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen’s Stock Picks With Huge Upside Potential - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQTmMtS2VoLUcxbFdhV3RmejVtUDVzYjZ6X2s0OUdSdVk3Q1FfbGlGTkVYVGV3UWN5aWRUck1UVktWWUFDTEx2Uzl2RmREQjFiUElkV0tVdlFQT0d2QVlNQ05DUVppcmtvZVd0NkJoZzh2Vld1U2RPenRhY0dYOUFyNGRpTHpWSGtEWHAycjRKTko?oc=5,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:38:16 GMT","We recently published a list of Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen’s 10 Stock Picks With Huge Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other billionaire Andreas Halvorsen’s stock picks with huge upside potential.

Ole Andreas Halvorsen is one of the prominent names among former employees of Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management. Robertson put together a formidable team of young traders – called the Tiger Cubs – in the 1990s, and most founded their own hedge funds after exit. Some other noteworthy names include Robert Citrone, Chase Coleman, and John Griffin. Halvorsen is the wealthiest Tiger Cub. Forbes Magazine ranks him at position 382 in the Richest People in the World in 2025 list with an $8 billion net worth.

The Norwegian billionaire founded Viking Global Investors LP in 1999 with former Tiger Management employees Brian Olson and David Ott. Halvorsen was an equity trader at Tiger Management, and the strategies and principles he used there form a core foundation of Viking Global’s approach. The fund conducts extensive due diligence on individual companies to identify undervalued (long) or overvalued (short) stocks. In short, Halvorsen generates much of his returns using the classic long/short equity strategy.

But most importantly, Halvorsen is popular for his bold bets. And on many occasions, these bets have returned massive gains. For instance, in the first full year of Viking Global’s existence, the fund returned 89% after fees. More recently, in Q4 2024, the billionaire made three banks his top holdings. As of April 2025, the banking sector (within Halvorsen’s portfolio) is performing well and is the only sector that is up year-to-date.

If anything, Halvorsen’s approach teaches that playing the long game might be a great strategy for favorable gains. Many of the stocks in Viking Global’s portfolio have been there for many years, often bought when they weren’t so popular. In that light, it is prudent to examine what stocks the billionaire is invested in, especially those with considerable upside potential.

Our Methodology

We reviewed Viking Global’s Q4 2024 SEC 13F filings to compile this list. Out of the 86 holdings, we focused only on shares in companies and excluded interests in ETFs and options. From the result, we selected the top 10 stocks with the highest upside potential (as of April 28). Additionally, we have mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock as of Q4 2024."

Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 7.4% in the morning session after the company announced it might be unable to sell some high-end chips (including the H20 chips) to China due to export controls and requirements from the Trump administration. Notably, Nvidia received an export restriction notice on April 9, 2025, suggesting the development was unanticipated heading into the quarter and likely not baked into its near-term sales forecast.

As a result, the company planned to take a $5.5 billion charge due to inventory writedowns and canceled sales.

The H20 chips were built for China to fit within limits set during the Biden administration. China brought in more than 10% of Nvidia's sales in fiscal 2025, so the new restrictions could still weigh hard on Nvidia's growth in the near term.

On a separate note, chip tool maker ASML posted weak bookings (a key demand indicator) which fell below Wall Street's expectations, noting that tariffs had made the industry's outlook more uncertain. The semiconductor industry's intricate supply chain means that ASML's performance has cascading effects on companies like Nvidia and AMD. Investors treat ASML's outlook as a proxy for demand in the industry, and if ASML's orders are down, it suggests chip producers are delaying capacity expansion.

ASML's CEO, Christophe Fouquet, called out ""customer cautiousness"" and a ""more gradual"" recovery in areas outside of AI. Such caution among customers can imply reduced demand by fabless chip designers such as Nvidia and AMD, affecting their short-term revenues and stock valuations.

The shares closed the day at $104.50, down 6.8% from previous close.

What The Market Is Telling Us

Nvidia’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 35 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 5.7% as markets rallied sharply on the news that President Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause. Reciprocal tariffs were also dropped to 10% for most countries, sparking renewed optimism amid ongoing trade talks. The major stock indices rose as investors, growing impatient of seemingly irrational tariff actions, welcomed the pause as a sign of a more measured path forward."

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +0.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.8% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share, indicating a change of +42.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.24 points to a change of +41.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -3.5%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.32 indicates a change of +25.5% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia."

Jim Cramer: NVIDIA (NVDA) Is “In All the Missiles”… But Right Now It’s “Just a Meme Stock” - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQNUpWSXRFN2FwdHVlMkxoRHRMVjFLQWgxc2oxaVlKbUNqMlkteEJQYnQwa045M0xxNE9YNkFLRlhiaXZva2ZQRjZvTXg2OU9zVlc0Rjc3TnRvTWNLN2xGX1dwUEI4aEpLdi1QaEhTU0NQRnBxb2xSSWMwQ2ZHZE5sTkVsOA?oc=5,"Wed, 16 Apr 2025 07:00:00 GMT","“Well, look, I’m not so certain I’m going to do a little contrary stuff on the dollar here. When we listen to conference calls, for the last four years, all we hear about is it would have been so much better if the dollar weren’t so strong. We keep losing share, the dollar’s too strong. Suddenly the dollar’s weaker, and now we start hearing all the downside, what, the bonds? I mean, I’m almost thinking that, I’m gonna put this out there, the people who are saying that it’s the end of the world, that the dollar is weaker, I think they have to go do some work boots on the ground. […] So suddenly the dollar’s weaker and we are petrified? These are people who have an agenda. And their agenda is to say, you know what matters more than anything else? Our hegemony from a strong dollar. And I don’t get it. If you’re in our business of picking stocks, you’re sick and tired of hearing CFOs say, we are done. We’ve got to stop this dollar rise.”

Turning to currency dynamics, Cramer pushed back on what he sees as misplaced panic over a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, he argued that a softer dollar actually benefits American multinationals and gives long-needed relief to CFOs who’ve spent years blaming currency strength for lost market share:

“So what I saw today, and not to be facetious, but what I see is people saying, you know what, we’ve seen the downside. Maybe we can test it again. But the president has, I don’t want to say blink, because that’s nonsense. What the president did was say, OK, look, we’re not going to continue to punish American companies and give the green light to Korea. I don’t know if you heard Lutnick’s words. He was very specific. Southeast Asia. That’s Samsung. They didn’t want to give the ball to Samsung.”

In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer reacted to the partial tariff exemptions announced by the White House, interpreting them not as a full retreat, but as a strategic pause designed to avoid punishing American companies. He suggested the administration was being careful not to hand over competitive advantages to Southeast Asian rivals, particularly Samsung:

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Sounds the Alarm on China Rhetoric and Dollar Panic Then Analyzes 11 Key Stocks . In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes.

Story Continues

Cramer also gave his opinion about the rhetoric coming from Beijing, likening it to the Cold War-era paranoia of the 1960s and ’70s. He questioned whether a diplomatic breakthrough similar to Nixon’s historic visit to China is even possible under the current tone of U.S.-China relations:

“But when I listen to the rhetoric from China, this is the 1968-72 rhetoric. It’s the kind of rhetoric that just says there’s never going to be a meeting. Is there a way to have a Nixon to China moment? Because as far as I’m concerned, this is just right now you’re on the verge of when I was a little boy and we kept thinking, when are they going to bomb us? I mean, that was the same rhetoric. When are they going to launch their nuclear weapons? I mean, that’s why we used to live in fear. That’s why we had cubbyholes. That’s why we used to put our heads in a cubbyhole, because the Chinese were going to bomb us if the Russians didn’t bomb us. This is the same sound.”

Cramer offered a multi-faceted take on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), discussing its expanding manufacturing efforts in the U.S. and strategic significance to national security. While praising its technological dominance, he also highlighted the stock’s extreme volatility and its status as a speculative favorite among retail traders. Here’s everything he said:

“I mean, I see NVIDIA saying it plans to manufacture some AI chips in the U.S. and they’re doing some right now in Taiwan’s semi-foundries. What you have to do is you have to say, OK, listen, guys, you have to sacrifice some margin. […]

Overall, NVDA ranks 6th on our list of key stocks that Jim Cramer analyzes. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

Consensus projects earnings of $0.89 per share, up 45% compared to last year, while revenues are estimated to grow by 65% year-over-year to $43 billion. Growth is likely to be driven by continued strong demand for the company’s GPU chips used for generative AI applications. In the previous quarter, Nvidia noted that it had ramped up large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, with their advanced AI capabilities and premium pricing, could help drive top-line growth over Q1 FY’26, (FY’25 ended Jan. 2025), while also bolstering margins. That said, investors will be watching Nvidia’s future outlook, especially amid rising uncertainty around U.S. trade policy and tariffs on key trading partners. The Trump administration is also looking at more closely regulating AI chip exports via the newly proposed AI diffusion rules, which could pose a significant risk to Nvidia’s long-term growth by limiting sales in key international markets.

Nvidia has $2.7 trillion in current market capitalization. Revenue over the last twelve months was $130 Bil, and it was operationally profitable with $81 Bil in operating profits and net income of $73 billion That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

NVIDIA’s Historical Odds Of Positive Post-Earnings Return

Some observations on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns:

There are 20 earnings data points recorded over the last five years, with 12 positive and 8 negative one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns were seen about 60% of the time.

and one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns were seen about 60% of the time. However, this percentage decreases to 58% if we consider data for the last 3 years instead of 5.

Median of the 12 positive returns = 4.6%, and median of the 8 negative returns = -6.3%

Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D), and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below.

Correlation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns

A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if the correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.

Is There Any Correlation With Peer Earnings?

Sometimes, peer performance can have an influence on post-earnings stock reaction. In fact, the pricing-in might begin before the earnings are announced. Here is some historical data on the past post-earnings performance of Nvidia stock compared with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings just before Nvidia. For fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings one-day (1D) returns.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks analysts are talking about amid Trump’s tariff war.

Markets saw some glimmer of hope as President Donald Trump indicated that he does not plan to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and showed openness to engage in talks with China. However, China has said in a statement that the US should dial back all unilateral duties if it’s serious in negotiations.

Andrew Slimmon, Morgan Stanley Investment Management senior portfolio manager, explained in a recent program on CNBC what made Trump blink:

“I think…April 9th was an important day because on that day Trump came out and said I didn’t like what I saw in the bond market, I didn’t like Jamie Diamon saying there’s a recession coming and he said “So I’m putting a 90-day pause on.” So in my opinion, what he really said is tariffs are important to me but a recession’s worse and so there’s the priority which he basically gave you the indication there is a Trump put out there. I don’t think it’s down 10 15 but it was when the market was almost down 20 right, credit spread started to quake.”

Like many of the big Wall Street names, the stock has been losing altitude – down 19% year-to-date.

So, is now the moment to load up on this perennial winner? Not if you ask Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg.

In a rare contrarian move amid widespread bullishness, Goldberg has launched coverage on Nvidia with a Sell rating and a $100 price target — currently the lowest on Wall Street. That implies NVDA has 8% further to fall from here.

“Nvidia is one of the leading beneficiaries of the current AI spending boom, but its prospects are well understood and largely priced into the stock,” the analyst argues.

Goldberg does credit one bright spot: clients are upgrading to Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell architecture, and the 2025 supply is already sold out – though that’s due in part to packaging constraints at TSMC.

But beyond that, Goldberg sees red flags stacking up. Demand may be sky-high, but the analyst argues the risks and saturation ahead make Nvidia far less of a sure bet than many bulls believe.

For one, the analyst thinks it’s quite difficult installing the products. “Our research indicates significant complexity required for deployments of Nvidia systems in comparison to traditional data centers – cooling, configuration and orchestration challenges throughout the supply chain,” explained Goldberg.

Additionally, the analyst says there is “strong momentum” among hyperscalers to develop in-house alternatives to Nvidia, as the company’s largest customers are actively pursuing the design of their own custom chips.

Add to that the geopolitical risks. With U.S.-China tech tensions still simmering, Nvidia’s international operations, and its cost structure, remain vulnerable to export restrictions and political shocks.

Looking at the bigger picture, Goldberg also thinks Nvidia is about to suffer from a shift on all things AI-related. The analyst talks of “mounting questions” about the practical utility of AI at the moment. This is a period of “growing pains” as customers work to identify viable use cases and find ways to generate meaningful returns on the big investments they’ve already made in AI.

Goldberg also thinks that in 2026, there will probably be a slowing of AI budgets and while he doesn’t think there is necessarily an AI bubble right now, it could take “many years before true utility becomes apparent.”

And even though Nvidia has been the chip stock to own, Goldberg thinks those days are over. “AI may do well this year, but NVDA is likely to underperform relative to peers,” the analyst summed up.

So, that’s a bear’s take, but there are no others currently on Wall Street sharing the same view. The stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on an additional 35 Buys and 5 Holds. Going by the $167.09 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a 58% premium. (See NVDA stock forecast)

Speaking at an event in Oklahoma City hosted by the Hamm Institute, Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president for global data centers, said recent chatter about Amazon Web Services scaling back on leases was simply a misunderstanding. Nothing's changed, he said, adding that Amazon's long-term growth expectations for AI infrastructure are still firmly in place.

Nvidia's Josh Parker had a similar message. He said fears that newer, more efficient AI technology like China's DeepSeek could hurt demand were an overreaction. He called the investor response a kneejerk and said Nvidia is still seeing strong growth in AI computing needs.

But while demand for AI keeps climbing, the industry is running into a new challenge: power. Jack Clark, co-founder of Anthropic, said the wave of new AI infrastructure could need around 50 gigawatts of extra electricity in the next few years about as much as building 50 nuclear plants. He called the scale of the demand unprecedented.

To tackle the problem, executives suggested that natural gas could end up playing a major role in powering the next generation of AI data centers.

For investors, the next big question will be how tech giants plan to keep their AI ambitions on track without hitting an energy wall.

Is NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) the Best Tech Stock to Buy For Long-Term Investment? - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9RS2dMbmo2X1lwQXYwVGdGNTFKQzFqNGlUX1pJMEc3XzZQY0ZHZzVGZ3FreVBjcEFaRDBnc01MUFpvZXVnTklyRlYxcDhMdmJGTHJraXJRRGxWRkcxVDdRRkFVMkQzWFVlVHpDem0xYnJRNE1FMm84LXVsYXlpNnM?oc=5,"Sat, 12 Apr 2025 07:00:00 GMT","We recently published a list of 12 Best Tech Stocks to Buy For Long-Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other tech stocks to buy for long-term investment.

On April 1, Chris Verrone, chief market strategist at Strategas Research Partners, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ to talk about his outlook on the tech sector. Verrone believes that most of the current market’s negative sentiment has already been factored into recent stock prices. He highlighted that even after the market’s decline, the VIX, and the currency and bond volatility are lower than they were during the mid-March stress period. Plus, fewer stocks are hitting new lows. He thinks that market lows are formed during periods of bad news, and the market will rally from its current level with an anticipated range of 5,900 to 5,950.

Verrone believes that the current downturn is more than a typical 10% correction so it will take some time to figure out the market’s true direction. He emphasized the importance of monitoring market breadth, new highs, and credit conditions in the upcoming weeks and months. He also acknowledged the shift in investor sentiment, with more bears than bulls. As the conversation touched on the impact of the Fed and politics in a market, Verrone stated that he pays more attention to what the 2-year Treasury yield tells him instead of listening to what Fed officials have to say. He noted that the 2-year yield’s decline from 3.83% to 3.85% suggests a shift in the market expectations for the Fed’s actions. He highlighted the resilience of financials during the correction and contrasted it with the weakness of tech. He thinks that, unlike financials that entered the correction as leaders, the tech sector might not be able to regain the leadership role.

While Verrone’s stance acknowledges the current weakness in tech, it’s important to note that the tech sector remains one of the more innovative markets in the long run. For instance, MAG7 continues to be a driving force for this market.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other aggressive growth stocks.

US stocks delivered a positive performance on Wednesday, April 23, after President Trump pointed out that he does not intend to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. This statement helped ease Wall Street’s fears about the independence of the central bank. Additionally, Trump softened his tone on tariffs and hinted that the high duties on Chinese imports could be scaled back in the future.

The Nasdaq led the gains as it increased by 2.5%. The S&P 500 rose nearly 1.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased about 1.1%, or 400 points. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq was up over 4% at one point and the Dow had added about 1,100 points. However, these gains faded after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters there has been “no unilateral offer from the president to deescalate” the trade war with China.

Despite this pullback, Wall Street remained optimistic because of President Trump’s softer tone on both the Fed and tariffs. On Tuesday, Trump said he expects China tariffs to come down significantly after Bessent had called the current tariffs “unsustainable.”

Trump also told reporters from the Oval Office that he never intended to remove Powell but repeated his desire for the Fed chair to lower interest rates. These comments brought relief to investors who had feared that a possible conflict between President Trump and Powell could add further uncertainty in a market that is already affected by tariffs.

Is Nvidia Stock (NVDA) Just Getting Started? Amazon’s AI Spending Ignites Fresh Chip Rally - TipRanks,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxOTkVGelRNazNwSTFmNUFucmtqTlJqVU1lODRuNEVHTkdUX1hNUy1oVHhaNjBGM2s3TTRpSldhMGM1TkstVVlucVdoNm9pMEVXUjlmTmJIN2I3Y01rSG5CWVNQOWUyRmRuSTd3N3V2ZzhQZ3hXeVc5NDZjampNMUNuNE55MURQWmpxTFJMR3pYTUVTTUptcnp3b0Vjc0tmeFE0cFJhM01MT2h1akRUXzhfMnNmN2RESEE?oc=5,"Fri, 02 May 2025 10:55:54 GMT","Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) climbed again Friday after Amazon confirmed it’s not slowing down on AI. With over $24 billion in Q1 capital expenditure and plans to hit $100 billion this year, Amazon’s (AMZN) push into infrastructure is fueling more than just cloud ambitions—it’s lighting a fire under the global semiconductor trade.

Amazon’s CapEx Surge Signals Real AI Commitment

Amazon’s Q1 report confirmed what markets hoped: AI is still priority number one. Capital expenditure jumped to $24.3 billion—up 75% from last year—and executives said the bulk of that is heading to AWS and AI-related buildouts. That includes chips like Amazon’s own Trainium, but also massive outlays on infrastructure to run large language models and AI services.

Why does this matter for Nvidia? Because even with Amazon designing custom chips, it still relies heavily on Nvidia GPUs for training and inference. Nvidia’s H100 and soon-to-launch B100 chips remain the most sought-after in hyperscale training environments. In short, custom silicon may complement, but not replace, Nvidia’s dominance.

AI Spending Is Global Infrastructure Spending

This isn’t just a tech story—it’s a macroeconomic one. Spending on AI infrastructure is becoming the new arms race among global tech titans, and Nvidia is at the heart of the supply chain. Analysts now view AI capex as the modern equivalent of digital industrial investment: it shapes trade flows, capital markets, and even geopolitical strategy.

The $100B Amazon budget mirrors moves from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), both of whom also pledged this week to increase AI infrastructure investment. As this spending moves downstream, it drives global demand for high-end semiconductors, memory, data center power capacity, and cooling technologies.

Confidence Returns to Growth Tech

The recent surge in capex reverses fears from last month, when rumors suggested Amazon was dialing back on AI investments. That narrative has now been torched. With confirmation that hyperscalers remain committed, Nvidia’s valuation is once again underpinned by actual multi-year demand forecasts—not just hype.

Investor confidence is also being reinforced by broader tech earnings beats, cooling inflation expectations, and signs of stable U.S. growth. Nvidia’s gain of 2.5% Thursday and another 0.8% premarket Friday signals strong appetite for risk-on AI plays heading into the summer.

Nvidia isn’t the only one benefiting. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose 0.7%, and Broadcom (AVGO) gained 0.9% in premarket as investors bet on broader supply chain tailwinds. Meanwhile, Taiwan and South Korea—home to key foundries—are seeing renewed demand signals. U.S.-China tensions over chips remain a variable risk, with potential to disrupt supply chains or shift trade dynamics, but for now, the west’s AI push is tightening trade routes toward friendly manufacturing zones.

Is NVDA Stock Still a Buy?

Wall Street is still all-in on Nvidia. According to TipRanks, 41 analysts currently cover the stock, with an overwhelming 35 rating it a Buy, just 5 calling it a Hold, and only one tagging it a Sell—giving Nvidia a clear Strong Buy consensus. The average 12-month NVDA price target sits at $165.22—implying a 48% upside from current levels—while the most bullish analysts see it hitting $200. That level of consensus isn’t just rare, it’s a signal: investors view Nvidia as the key beneficiary of the AI arms race.

Stock Market Sell-Off: Should You Buy the Dip on Nvidia Stock? - The Motley Fool,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNV3A4a0FHUEhrUFM2ZHpSWk1RUGI1enN1U3c1b0NMUWhIdmZDd1M4bklWRVc3U1lRQjlUeURWOXVLSFVENE9JUDNPdFNTMEcxWU5nWEgzVXVMLTBLRWxiYTFUTnBMRmt6NzNLR3FiZDZmX2g5WGoyXzNuWXZTd2pXN2R5T1dXRDY1ZFBxU3pvOEhVY0xGci14aQ?oc=5,"Thu, 01 May 2025 11:45:00 GMT","With shares down nearly 20% year to date, Nvidia (NVDA 2.33%) had a rough start to 2025. The massive artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker has proven vulnerable to trade and geopolitical uncertainty during the opening months of the Trump administration, which could seriously undermine its business in China.

Let's dig deeper to determine whether investors should view this dip as a buying opportunity or a signal to stay away from Nvidia stock.

A catch-22 situation in China?

Nvidia's China trouble came to a head on April 16 when the Trump administration imposed new restrictions on the exports of its H20 AI chips to the country. This hardware was specifically designed to comply with Biden-era regulations, which blocked sales of its more powerful flagship chips like the A100 and H100 to China. The new ban led to a $5.5 billion impairment charge as Nvidia must now write down the value of its massive inventory and purchase commitments for the H20 program.

This situation is quite complicated for Nvidia, as it offers a mix of potential advantages and disadvantages. For starters, the H20 is believed to have helped the Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek develop its R1 and V3 models, which can match American industry leader ChatGPT on some benchmarks at a fraction of the cost.

Intense competition from China promises to squeeze potential margins in the AI software market, which could undermine Nvidia's biggest clients, including OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. As a result, these companies may become less willing to invest billions into an industry trapped in a race to the bottom.

By selling H20 chips to China, Nvidia may have been hurting the long-term viability of its U.S.-reliant business model. And the chip ban may actually have a stabilizing effect on the U.S. AI industry by slowing down Chinese progress, although this theory is far from guaranteed.

Could Chinese chips overtake Nvidia?

On April 27, Chinese tech giant Huawei announced plans to test its newest and most powerful AI processor, called the 910D, which is designed to replace Nvidia's products in the country. By banning Nvidia's H20 in China, the U.S. may have inadvertently created a less competitive environment, allowing Chinese rivals to develop their domestic chip-design capabilities and eventually imitate Nvidia's business model.

The good news is that Nvidia's economic moat relies on its software solution, CUDA, which makes it easier for developers to use its chips relative to rivals. And while Huawei could eventually dominate the Chinese market, it is unlikely to challenge Nvidia's dominance outside of China anytime soon.

Even experienced chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Broadcom have yet to crack Nvidia's dominance (with a market share of 70% to 95%) in the AI chip market.

Over the long term, Chinese developers could use low-cost chips designed by Huawei and other companies to compete with American AI on consumer-facing software. However, the loss of access to Nvidia products could slow them down enough for Nvidia's top clients to maintain their lead.

Should you buy the dip on Nvidia?

Nvidia's recent dip reflects more than just a reduction of hype in the AI industry. The Trump administration's decision to block the company's H20 sales to China will have a significant impact on its long-term growth. In fiscal 2025, Nvidia's China business accounted for approximately $7.9 billion, or 6% of its total sales of $130.5 billion, which is a substantial amount.

With geopolitical tensions on the rise, it may not be in Nvidia's best interest to continue developing specialized AI chips for the Chinese market, given the risk of continued bans.

That said, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25, Nvidia's valuation still looks reasonable, considering its growth rate. Fourth-quarter profits jumped 80% year over year to $19.3 billion. But stocks are only worth what someone else is willing to pay for them. Investors may doubt Nvidia's ability to sustain its epic growth rate, especially in such a speculative industry that isn't yet a significant part of the mainstream economy. Shares look like a hold until more information becomes available."

Shares were down by more than 30% at one point, wiping more than $1 trillion off the company's valuation.

After a brief rebound, shares are now down by just 20% year to date. The stock isn't as cheap as it was a few weeks ago, but this is still an incredible chance for patient investors to lock in a great price for a business that should grow exponentially in the years to come. There's one reason in particular that should get investors very excited.

Why Nvidia is worth $2.7 trillion

Nvidia is one of the most valuable companies in the world for a reason. Its graphic processing units (GPUs) are some of the best in the world.

For AI applications in particular, its GPUs are considered the best in the world. They are crucial components that make the AI revolution possible, allowing companies to train and execute large models that require huge data sets to run properly.

Its next-gen Blackwell chips have performance benchmarks that few companies can match. But it's not just about raw performance. The hardware is supported by a software suite called Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA).

CUDA allows developers to customize Nvidia's GPUs to their specific uses, unlocking performance upgrades that make the company's GPUs even more attractive. And once a customer is using CUDA, it essentially locks it into Nvidia's hardware and software, giving the chipmaker control over both ends of the value chain.

In summary, Nvidia has some of the best chips on the market, especially for AI applications, and its CUDA suite creates a durable competitive advantage when it comes to customer stickiness by embedding itself directly into its customers' products from both a hardware and a software perspective. That's an incredibly valuable position considering the AI industry as a whole is expected to surpass $4 trillion by 2033, up from just $189 billion in 2023.

The company's future is bright on many levels. And some recent comments from Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore should get investors even more excited about its long-term prospects.

There's no bubble, one analyst says

The recent pullback in Nvidia's stock price stemmed from many causes. The market overall took a dive earlier this year, dragging many of the biggest names down with it.

But given Nvidia's meteoric rise, many investors are also worried we're in the middle of an AI bubble, pushing valuations far beyond what is reasonable. These investors fear that even more downside is to come, but recent comments from Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore should provide some relief.

In a note to clients last week, Moore wrote: ""The idea that we are in a digestion phase for AI is laughable given the obvious need for more inference chips which is driving a wave of very strong demand. Those who want to see this as a bubble are manifesting that through the various conversations about longer-term data center leases, but it's hard to have that view when you talk to actual customers about actual demand which remains strong.""

Those comments certainly line up with Nvidia's backlog figures. Many of its chips have 12-month wait lists, and there's been little sign from data center operators -- a key customer category for Nvidia's GPUs -- that spending won't grow tremendously in the years to come, even if there is some short-term noise along the way. ""We are hearing about demand levels that are tens of billions above current run rates, limited by supply,"" Moore said in his note.

The AI revolution is far from over. And even with a premium valuation, Nvidia still trades at just 25 times forward earnings, hardly unreasonable for a profitable company growing this quickly.

With such huge demand projected for AI GPUs through this decade and beyond, don't be surprised to see Nvidia's stock continue to soar well beyond today's $2.7 trillion valuation."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against stocks with consistent growth to buy now.

The market is clouded by friction between trading partners. But even at these uncertain times, one investment strategy remains remarkably consistent: betting on growth.

Investors are consistently drawn toward companies that have demonstrated a solid long-term expansion in revenue and earnings. The mechanism behind this is simple: stocks with stable growth offer the potential for compounding returns over time in low-rate environments. Lately, however, the stocks have done more than just show potential. They are leading the market.

On April 22, 2025, the market indices surged by 2.5%, contributed by renewed confidence in the ability of high-growth equities to endure the market uncertainty. As per a report from CNBC, confidence emerged after the de-escalation of tensions in U.S. monetary policy.

Recent political developments have detoured the market sentiment towards further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. President Trump has backed off from his threats towards the Fed Chair Jerome Powell. However, he firmly believes that the Fed should be more aggressive in lowering interest rates. When this belief was put in words, an immediate surge was noticed in the equity index futures, suggesting the high sensitivity of the market policy cues, particularly when it comes to growth potential.

Investors took the cue seriously, pricing in three interest rate cuts by the end of 2025. For growth-oriented companies, the lower borrowing costs can be favorable, specifically if they are in their early to mid-stages of expansion, since capital costs can be reduced and earnings multiples can be improved. Also, with inflationary pressures still in check and the global economic activity indicating resilience, the macroeconomic environment favors growth investing. It shows that the current climate supports equities positioned for sustained performance instead of short-term valuation plays.

Not just today, but growth stocks have historically proven their worth in the market for over three decades. These stocks have surpassed their value counterparts in performance, even after considering the major downturns.

During economic volatility or even political flux, investors seek clarity. And the provider of such clarity or edge is the growth equities. These companies often reinvest profits and innovate rapidly to achieve more market share. Though they may not always deliver dividends, they reward investors through capital appreciation. During the recovery phases, investors desire such appreciation, which comes in addition to the safety of the investment. As CNBC’s recent coverage notes, recoveries are initiated in the form of bear market rallies, and the investors capable of identifying early movers in such cycles typically come out ahead."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other machine-learning stocks.

Grand View Research reported that the global machine-learning market was valued at $36.73 billion in 2022. It’s now expected to grow at a 34.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. Machine learning helps machines and systems learn from experience instead of through explicit programming. It uses algorithms to improve and analyze vast amounts of complex data to make informed decisions. Machine learning is quickly progressing as AI is rapidly expanding and transforming how businesses and individuals operate. These technological advancements are revolutionizing consumer experiences, and enabling convenient creation of digital services, products, and optimized supply chains. With this, startups can focus on specific solutions while larger companies can deliver comprehensive AI platforms.

On April 10, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the cost of AI and what has to happen to bring it down. Jassy emphasized that the growth in data center demand is now so significant that there is no foreseen attenuation here, even with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties under tariffs. While there’s a general belief that the emergence of DeepSeek could now reduce the need for extensive data centers, processing power, and energy consumption previously forecasted at different tech companies, Jassy thinks that DeepSeek’s introduction did not disrupt any of this. Despite cost reductions that occurred have already over time, AI deployment still requires significant investment. He thinks that the current AI operations are expensive due to chip costs and other factors, but big techs, including his own company, would welcome any reductions in AI costs for customers moving forward.

Jassy underscored the demand for data centers despite tariff impacts and reflected optimism regarding lowering costs, which would potentially drive innovation and expanded use of AI across industries. AI is still limited and requires substantial human oversight as of now but it has massive potential across various sectors.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks to watch amid market volatility.

The uncertain macroeconomic environment is diminishing investors’ readiness to pay high prices for stocks related to artificial intelligence. Despite the continued buzz around the technology, no one seems interested in buying the falling stocks. Fluctuating tariff policies from the Trump administration have concerned Wall Street and disrupted global supply chains. The cost of AI infrastructure has increased drastically, especially for companies relying on imported components.

The narrative around AI stocks has also begun to change because investors are critiquing that prices have become too expensive, and because there is intensifying competition from Chinese companies developing their own AI offerings.

In the latest news, seven Republican U.S. senators have also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The letter urges him to get rid of a Biden administration rule that restricts global access to AI chips before it kicks in next month. The letter claims that the AI diffusion rule will deter U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, which is why it demands an “immediate action” to halt it. The rule is set to take effect on May 15.

“Every day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained. We urge you to withdraw this rule and propose an alternative that is effective in preventing Communist China from capturing the world market in leading technology without compromising American advantages.”

It also noted how the rule puts countries into three tiers, with only 18 nations in the Tier 1 group with the easiest access to American technology. Those in tier 2 have to face “arbitrary purchase limits and a cumbersome licensing process.” Meanwhile, it asserted that Tier 3 countries are already “rightly restricted.”

For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.

Huawei’s AI ambitions put fresh pressure on Nvidia

Huawei is preparing to test a powerful new artificial intelligence chip designed to challenge some of Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.54% ) top offerings, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Ascend 910D represents a major step in China’s push to build a self-sufficient tech industry despite U.S. sanctions. Nvidia shares fell about 1.5% in premarket trading following the report.

Domino’s delivers a mixed slice

Domino’s beat earnings expectations but missed on revenue, posting adjusted EPS of $4.33 against estimates of $4.07. CEO Russell Weiner said the company is staying focused on “controlling what is under its control” in a “challenging macroeconomic environment,” while celebrating early progress under its “Hungry for MORE” five-year plan. U.S. same-store sales declined 0.5%, while international same-store sales rose 3.7% excluding currency impacts. Domino’s stock slipped roughly 2% before the bell.

More earnings on tap after the close

Waste Management (WM+1.00% ) will report after the close, with investors zeroing in on margin trends and pricing power. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI-0.15% ) is expected to offer an early read on global chip demand, where a year-over-year earnings decline is projected. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS-1.80% ) could provide a key window into how much R&D spending chipmakers are sustaining in a tighter environment.

Visa and Coca-Cola headline Tuesday’s slate, with Big Tech to follow

Tuesday brings results from Visa (V-0.28% ), Coca-Cola (KO-0.01% ), Booking Holdings (BKNG+2.44% ), and Novartis (NVS-0.56% ). Later in the week, Microsoft (MSFT-0.92% ) and Meta (META-2.36% ) are set to headline earnings after the bell Wednesday, offering critical updates on cloud growth, AI momentum, and digital advertising trends.

Amazon (AMZN-2.87% ) and Apple (AAPL-0.39% ) follow on Thursday, with Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A-0.82% ) closing out the week on Friday — wrapping up one of the busiest earnings stretches of the year.

CEO pessimism on the rise

Adding to the pressure, S&P 500 companies’ leadership mentioned “worse” or “weaker” far more often than “better” or “stronger” during first-quarter earnings calls, with optimism falling to its lowest ratio since 2008."
Nvidia (NVDA) Plans New AI Chips to Avoid Export Rules and Keep China Business Alive - TipRanks,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOZjVFREN3QVc5MDVrMHpTRkgyUnUwZUpQVzFrQkxmeHlGc1dnTWtacDhrdXBNcGRNSGpheW5hLWxTZ2JURml1ZTQ1RWhLc2Z0LXNoNk43WFVxRUtadVdjSUpfUTdPT3ppSkJKa2hGWXNtQnoybGpLSzFIR2V2UGRFU0xrRGtlNG5XOXJDTWxHSlBGVDZVWmZmT2x0bDNXc0ZYMHlCV0xJQjlmbDk3UTM0QXJB?oc=5,"Fri, 02 May 2025 14:54:24 GMT","Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is reportedly redesigning some of its AI chips so they can still be sold to Chinese companies without breaking U.S. export rules, according to The Information. The company has shared these plans with major Chinese customers, including Alibaba (BABA), ByteDance (the parent company of TikTok), and Tencent (TCEHY). CEO Jensen Huang told customers about the new strategy during his trip to Beijing in mid-April, which happened just after the U.S. placed new restrictions on exporting Nvidia’s H20 AI chips to China.

These export limits could cost Nvidia $5.5 billion, as the restricted H20 was the main chip it was still allowed to sell in China. To get around this issue, Nvidia told customers that samples of its redesigned chip could be ready as soon as June. The company also said that it is working on a special version of its latest-generation Blackwell AI chip made specifically for the Chinese market in order to stay within U.S. rules.

Unsurprisingly, selling AI chips to China has become a sensitive and challenging issue. U.S. officials want to limit China’s access to powerful AI technology, so Nvidia has started making chips designed to meet those restrictions without losing its Chinese customers. While Nvidia did not comment on the report, the situation shows the tough task Nvidia has of following U.S. laws while protecting its business in a key market.

Is NVDA a Good Stock to Buy?

Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on NVDA stock based on 35 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average NVDA price target of $165.22 per share implies 45.2% upside potential.

Stock-Split Watch: Is Nvidia Next? - The Motley Fool,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPWHJGWko4R19kd2Q2VzhackdHQUE4eFU1TTlhNE9ycTNPNjRZa0JVTVpqd0pzck9TN2FMNlFhRjUtTHJnV3l0Y3RYbjNfVnJ2VFJDczQzSzMxMGhFWXl5RjIycVl5NjRCcmlNSkVvVUJMTVplRzBGNV9WZThTSkxJNw?oc=5,"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:11:00 GMT","It was nearly one year ago that Nvidia (NVDA 2.33%) last split its stock. That 10-for-1 stock split was the sixth in the company's history since entering the public markets in 1999. Shares proceeded to march to an all-time closing high about six months after last June's stock split.

Shares have since retreated along with many others as the Nasdaq Composite index briefly entered bear market territory in early April, declining more than 20% off recent highs. Yet Nvidia has been resilient and its share prices have recently rebounded. While the downturn in the stock market may not be over, it will eventually gain ground again. Nvidia continues to have a leading business covering artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, robotics, driver assistance, and self-driving technologies.

Stock-split facts

That business is what should attract investors to Nvidia stock. Another stock split could also be in its future, though. And history shows that owning shares before they split can pay off.

To determine why that might be, let's look at reasons companies split their stocks in the first place. After all, a split doesn't affect the value of the company one bit and even adds some expenses in logistics, legal fees, and other nominal costs.

Splitting a stock can increase liquidity by making shares more affordable for a larger group of investors. Retail investors are likely part of the increased trading volume because lower-priced shares look more attractive to those just starting out or with limited funds to invest. Fractional shares are offered at many brokerages now, but most people probably don't utilize that rarely-promoted option. So a lower share price can appeal to more buyers. It is a perception of affordability.

Companies also tend to split stocks that have trended higher. Announcing a split tends to give investors added confidence that further strong performance is ahead. The stock may also be included in more major stock indexes, especially those that use price-weighted calculations. Lastly, splits may also be announced with company employees in mind. Employee share purchase plans may get more participation if shares are more affordable to participants.

Value ahead for Nvidia

So while stock splits don't directly affect the company's value, i.e., its market capitalization doesn't change, investor perception and market activity can tend to aid future performance. Nvidia management can also look beyond short-term volatility toward positive future business developments to gain confidence to announce another stock split.

Most investors are focusing on Nvidia's growing data center revenue. That segment accounted for the bulk of its revenue growth in the past fiscal year ended Jan. 26, 2025. But each of its other three segments has increased revenue annually over the last two years. Gaming is a more than $10 billion segment. It only accounted for about 9% of sales last year, though, so many investors are discounting Nvidia's other growth areas.

Perhaps its greatest growth potential comes from automotive and robotics end uses. That segment is at a much lower base than data centers, and its total addressable market could be ready to go through a growth spurt. Automakers already include advanced driver assistance packages and may be on the cusp of selling fully autonomous vehicles. Robotics technology may also be at the point of transition from stationary industrial uses to mobile, humanoid versions that can help businesses further improve efficiency.

Is a stock split coming?

Those are better reasons to buy Nvidia stock than anticipating the next stock split. History does show that a split announcement could result in market-beating returns. Yet I think Nvidia stock will outpace the market simply for fundamental reasons.

Nvidia's management and board of directors will likely wait for ongoing market turmoil to settle before announcing its next stock split. It makes sense for investors to own the stock regardless, though. That way, you can participate in a fast-growing company along with any future stock splits that might be announced."

Reports from the weekend indicated that China’s Huawei Technologies has developed an AI chip to directly challenge Nvidia.

What To Know: Huawei has developed a new AI processor called Ascend 910D that it hopes will be a replacement for some higher-end chips made by Nvidia, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

People familiar with the matter said Huawei already approached some Chinese technology companies with intentions of testing the technical practicability of the new chip.

Development of the chip is still in the early stages, but the company could reportedly receive its first sample batches by late May. This latest version of the company’s Ascend AI processor is expected to be more powerful than Nvidia's H100.

The news comes after Nvidia said in a regulatory filing earlier this month that the U.S. government informed the company that it will need a license to export certain chips to China, focused on the company’s H20 chips.

A license will also be required for any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or a combination thereof, Nvidia said in the filing.

As a result of the restrictions, Nvidia said it expects its first-quarter financial results to include up to $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products held in inventory. Nvidia’s fiscal first quarter ended on Sunday and the company is due to report financial results for the period next month.

Analysts currently expect the chipmaker to report earnings of 88 cents per share and revenue of $43.09 billion, according to estimates from Benzinga Pro.

Huawei’s new chip is the latest version of its Ascend processor, with previous versions being called 910B and 910C. The report indicates that the Chinese chipmaker is expected to ship more than 800,000 Ascend 910B and 910C chips to customers this year. Some buyers are also reportedly in talks to increase orders following the chip restrictions from the Trump administration.

NVDA Price Action: Nvidia shares were down 0.96% at $109.94 at the time of publication Monday, according to Benzinga Pro.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top stocks to watch as investors brace for recession.

Despite some optimism in the market after President Donald Trump’s indication of possible talks with China, Wall Street analysts are warning about recession risks due to the impending impact of tariffs and an overall decline in consumer sentiment.

Adam Parker, Trivariate Research CEO, said in a recent interview with CNBC that it’s “hard” to be bullish in this market because the impact of tariffs is yet to be reflected in companies’ earnings.

Parker thinks that in the coming days, earnings reports of many companies will begin to show that we are indeed facing an economic slowdown:

“You know there’s a difference between a growth scare and and then an actual growth slowdown I think in this case it is a growth slowdown I don’t know how much of it is yet and that’s where I think the challenge is but you can’t just say oh it’s an irrational growth scare that everyone has and it’s like an uncertain I think if you have a business with pricing power if you have a business that you know you can be okay. But there’s a lot of economically sensitive businesses we’re going to hear from next week and the week after if you think about how earning season typically unfolds where we may get guidance that isn’t quite as peachy as we’ve seen from you know the original guys in the banks and then some of the higher quality tech companies have reported.”

NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings Per Share Growth as at Apr 2025

Uncover 13 companies that survived and thrived after COVID and have the right ingredients to survive Trump's tariffs.

NVIDIA's recent partnership with Trend Micro, incorporating AI-driven threat detection, could significantly reinforce its AI capabilities. This collaboration is supported by NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture, which is expected to enhance its data center and AI workload prospects. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder return has exceeded 1,397%, showing very large growth, reflecting strong market confidence. This remarkable performance places NVIDIA ahead of its competitors, with NVIDIA having outperformed the US Semiconductor industry, which saw a 7.9% increase last year, and the broader US market, which experienced a 7.7% rise over the same period.

The integration of NVIDIA technology into cybersecurity frameworks could influence revenue and earnings forecasts positively, as analysts anticipate a 30.1% annual revenue growth rate over the next three years. This substantial expected growth aligns with NVIDIA's diversifying ventures in the automotive sector through partnerships with Toyota and Uber. With a current share price close to US$98.89, the consensus analyst price target of US$164.74 suggests a significant potential upside, being 40.0% higher. However, the target hinges on sustained earnings growth and efficiency gains, amidst uncertainty from regulatory and geopolitical challenges. As NVIDIA continues to solidify its position in multiple high-growth sectors, such technological alliances may bolster its prospects further.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.

Nvidia’s annual software developer conference, GTC, is in full swing. With its latest announcements, the company is doing all it can to assure investors of its dominance in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence industry. On Tuesday, CEO Jensen Huang delivered a keynote address in front of a packed hockey stadium in San Jose, California.

He noted how he believes that humanoid robots are less than five years away from wide use in manufacturing facilities. In this regard, he unveiled software tools that would reportedly help humanoid robots navigate the world more easily. Huang talked about humanoid robots when asked what signs would show that AI had become ubiquitous.

Huang said it may be ""when, literally, humanoid robots are wandering around, which is not five years away. This is not five-years-away problem, this is a few-years-away problem.""

Huang asserted that the manufacturing industry is probably going to be the first to adopt humanoid robots. This is because it has well-defined tasks that robots can easily handle in a controlled environment.

""I think it ought to go to factories first. And the reason for that is because the domain is much more guard-railed, and the use case is much more specific. The value of it is very, very easy to determine. The going rate for renting a human robot is probably $100,000 and I think it's pretty good economics.""

The chipmaker's CEO reportedly has big plans for the AI data center industry too. Debuting silicon photonics networking systems, Huang noted that their Spectrum-X and Quantum-X photonics can join hundreds and even thousands of GPUs, enabling data center companies to deploy up to 1 million GPU clusters.

Huang further noted how those million cluster data centers will be connected to other million-dollar data centers nearby to form massive data center facilities.

“Over the next several years, we're going to be building giant AI factories. Not normal AI factories … ones you see from space.”

The GTC keynote also talked about the company’s latest advancements, from Spectrum-X and Quantum-X photonics to Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin Superchips, which are going to help customers operate powerful AI systems to drive better revenue opportunities."

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed.

In his appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street on Thursday, Jim Cramer commented on small-cap stocks, Mexican stocks, homebuilder stocks, and sectors that the money moving out of tariff-exposed stocks might flow into. Commenting on the fact that Mexican stocks thrived while US stocks sank, Cramer linked the country’s decision to work with President Trump as being behind the strong performance. “I know well look I, they turned out to be not bad,” he said. “You paid the piper and you bring the stuff in. The piper’s not as bad as you thought. And it’s really good,” Cramer added.

Shifting to the small-cap stocks, Cramer explained why the Russel index had entered a bear market. The index lost 10.7% on Thursday and Friday, and according to Cramer, the downward movement is due to multiples shrinking. He shared:

“This is a multiple shrinking. We’re going to go to 16 times 26′ numbers. That’s how you have to figure it out. You just take look at those. And that’s where we’re gonna go.”

The CNBC host didn’t hold back when it came to either clarity or calling the tariffs ‘reciprocal.’ He reiterated that the markets were reducing valuation multiples as tariffs can impact corporate earnings. According to him:

“. . we won’t get clarity. Like everyone was thinking about that so called clearing event. That was nothing. Reciprocal as we said we threw out immediately. I just think that you’re downsized. And you ought to keep some capital so that when we get there, because we can get there. I’m not saying the end of the world, but I am saying, yeah, we’re going back to a very low multiple.”

He added: “I came on the Today Show, in 2007 and I said if you needed money anytime in the next five years, you should sell. And it was a great call.”

As for homebuilder stocks, Cramer pointed out that “rates are coming down. Mortgage rates are coming down pretty severely,” and wondered if this means that it’s time to buy. “I mean, do you buy the homebuilders,” he wondered.

Nvidia $NVDA Eyes Adding Bitcoin $BTC to Balance Sheet: Trading Implications and Market Impact - Blockchain News,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxPRVEzVENQa1VwYmxPY0xKcnZsSUlYMjFOTTAtS043NnV1VGV2R0pHWnpMT011QWtTVDI1UjU1cWVPZV9XOVozT0wzNkxoSUx3S3V3N255WVB4ZElzaHFUSURrS3hfa1BuX0JVYlRLM3J2c3FnMjFVbjNZb0RRYzZXZ2JiMzcxNWpzS3hGd3pQN3M3ZWZPd09aMm5aakZwaEZIVEZWM0dmMDBJdkxmRUJEb01aLXZUd3ZzSWtHMmg1ZUp6ZWM?oc=5,"Mon, 05 May 2025 06:15:24 GMT","Analysis

On May 5, 2025, a significant rumor surfaced on social media via a tweet from Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) at 14:23 UTC, claiming that Nvidia ($NVDA), a leading technology company specializing in GPUs and AI computing, is reportedly considering adding Bitcoin ($BTC) to its corporate balance sheet. This news, if confirmed, could have profound implications for both the cryptocurrency and AI technology markets, given Nvidia's pivotal role in powering AI infrastructure. As of the timestamp of the tweet, Bitcoin was trading at $68,742 on Binance, reflecting a 3.2% increase within the prior 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data accessed at 15:00 UTC on May 5, 2025. Trading volume for BTC/USDT on Binance spiked by 18% during the hour following the tweet, reaching $1.87 billion between 14:00 and 15:00 UTC, as reported by Binance's live trading data. This surge suggests immediate market interest in the potential crossover between AI giants and cryptocurrency adoption. Additionally, AI-related tokens such as Render Token ($RNDR) saw a 5.7% price increase to $11.23 on Coinbase within the same hour, per Coinbase's price feed at 15:10 UTC, indicating a possible correlation between Nvidia's rumored move and AI-crypto market sentiment. On-chain data from Glassnode, accessed at 15:30 UTC on May 5, 2025, shows a 12% uptick in Bitcoin wallet addresses holding over 1 BTC, suggesting growing institutional interest around the time of the rumor. This event could mark a pivotal moment for corporate adoption of digital assets, especially from a company deeply embedded in AI innovation, and traders are keenly monitoring for official confirmation from Nvidia's investor relations or SEC filings, as no official statement has been released as of 16:00 UTC on May 5, 2025 (Source: Crypto Rover Tweet, CoinMarketCap, Binance, Coinbase, Glassnode).



The trading implications of Nvidia potentially adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet are multifaceted, particularly for those focused on cryptocurrency market trends and AI-crypto correlations. If confirmed, this move could mirror previous corporate adoptions like MicroStrategy's Bitcoin purchases, which historically catalyzed significant BTC price rallies, such as the 22% surge in November 2020 following their initial acquisition announcement, per historical data from CoinGecko accessed at 16:15 UTC on May 5, 2025. For traders, key pairs to watch include BTC/USDT, which recorded a trading volume of $2.1 billion on Binance between 15:00 and 16:00 UTC on May 5, 2025, and RNDR/USDT, which saw $87 million in volume on KuCoin during the same period, according to exchange data. The correlation between AI tokens and Bitcoin is evident as market sentiment shifts, with AI-driven projects potentially benefiting from Nvidia's involvement in crypto. On-chain metrics from Dune Analytics, accessed at 16:30 UTC, indicate a 9% increase in transactions on AI-related token networks like RNDR and FET (Fetch.ai) within 24 hours of the rumor, suggesting heightened retail and institutional activity. For trading opportunities, long positions on BTC could target resistance at $70,000, last tested on April 28, 2025, per Binance charts, while AI tokens like RNDR might see momentum toward $12.50 if bullish sentiment persists. Conversely, traders should remain cautious of volatility if Nvidia refutes the rumor, as sudden reversals could trigger sell-offs. Monitoring social media sentiment via tools like LunarCrush, which reported a 15% spike in positive mentions of 'Nvidia Bitcoin' between 14:30 and 16:30 UTC on May 5, 2025, can provide real-time insights into market direction (Source: CoinGecko, Binance, KuCoin, Dune Analytics, LunarCrush).



From a technical perspective, Bitcoin's price action post-rumor shows promising indicators for traders. As of 17:00 UTC on May 5, 2025, BTC/USDT on Binance exhibited a bullish breakout above the 50-day moving average at $67,500, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbing to 62, indicating potential for further upside before overbought conditions, per TradingView data. The MACD line crossed above the signal line at 16:45 UTC, reinforcing bullish momentum, as noted on the hourly chart. Trading volume analysis reveals sustained interest, with Binance reporting $2.3 billion in BTC/USDT volume between 16:00 and 17:00 UTC, a 10% increase from the prior hour. For AI tokens, RNDR/USDT on Coinbase showed a tightening Bollinger Band width at 17:15 UTC, suggesting an imminent volatility spike, with volume reaching $45 million in the same hour, per Coinbase data. On-chain metrics from Santiment, accessed at 17:30 UTC, highlight a 14% rise in daily active addresses for RNDR, correlating with the Nvidia news sentiment. For BTC, whale transactions over $100,000 increased by 8% within 24 hours, per Whale Alert data at 17:45 UTC on May 5, 2025, indicating institutional accumulation. Traders focusing on AI-crypto crossover opportunities should monitor correlations between $BTC and AI tokens like $RNDR and $FET, as Pearson correlation coefficients show a 0.78 positive relationship over the past week, per CryptoCompare data at 18:00 UTC. This Nvidia rumor underscores how AI developments can directly influence crypto market dynamics, potentially driving trading volume and price action in related assets (Source: TradingView, Binance, Coinbase, Santiment, Whale Alert, CryptoCompare).



In summary, the rumored involvement of Nvidia in Bitcoin adoption as of May 5, 2025, presents unique trading opportunities at the intersection of AI and cryptocurrency markets. Traders leveraging this news should focus on precise entry and exit points using the technical indicators and volume data provided, while staying updated on official confirmations. This event exemplifies the growing synergy between AI technology advancements and digital asset markets, a trend likely to shape future trading strategies. (Total words: 614)"

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks to buy and hold for 10 years.

When the stock market experiences a sharp decline, as it did after the Trump administration announced tariffs on its trade partners and China responded with retaliatory tariffs, many investors start looking into “buying the dip.” They start talking about buying stocks at temporarily lower prices with the hope that they will recover and bring gains in the future. There is often discussion in online communities like Reddit about whether to buy the dip.

However, financial advisors urge clients to stick with long-term investment plans during market volatility. While buying cheap can be a good idea, experts warn that it is nearly impossible to try and time the market and wait for the perfect moment to buy at the lowest price.

Eric Roberge, certified financial planner and CEO of Beyond Your Hammock in Boston, says that it is impossible to time the market without simply getting lucky. Instead, he suggests sticking to a thoughtful, rules-based investment strategy that focuses not on short-term market swings but on your long-term goals.

Jay Spector, certified financial planner and co-chief executive officer of EverVest Financial in Scottsdale, Arizona, explains that when buying assets during a market downturn, it is important to have a disciplined approach. Some people may be tempted to wait in cash while looking to buy at rock-bottom prices. However, no one can predict where that bottom is.

Waiting on the sidelines could mean missing out and might not be the right strategy. Research has shown that some of the best returns can follow the biggest dips. Spector says that instead of hoping to buy at the absolute bottom, investors should consider “dollar-cost averaging,” which means investing a fixed amount of money at set intervals.

Most importantly, experts say that investors should know why they want to invest in the first place. Sticking to your long-term goals can be key to successful investing during times of uncertainty and market panic.

Methodology

To compile our list of the 12 best stocks to buy and hold for 10 years, we looked for stocks with strong growth potential. We used search terms like “best stocks to buy and hold for 10 years” and reviewed financial media reports and various online resources to compile a list of more than 30 stocks that investors can consider buying and holding for the next decade. Next, we focused on the top 12 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 database of more than 1,000 elite hedge funds. Finally, the 12 best stocks to buy and hold for 10 years were ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q4 2024.

Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an American multinational technology company that designs and manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs), which play a vital role in gaming, professional applications, and AI. The company is a leader in AI hardware and software and is also known for its high-performance computing (HPC) solutions. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the best stocks to buy and hold for 10 years.

On April 16, Mizuho Securities kept an “Outperform” rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a price target of $168. This decision came even after the corporation’s recent 8-K filing revealed new export restrictions imposed by the US Government that are expected to affect shipments of NVIDIA’s H20 series products to China, including Hong Kong, and to other countries under US arms embargoes. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) said these new restrictions could impact about $5.5 billion in revenue, which is a large part of the estimated $16 billion in H20 orders. This suggests that over $10 billion worth of these products could have already been shipped for the calendar year 2025. Despite these export restrictions, Mizuho analysts have a positive outlook on NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) future prospects. This optimism is supported by the shipment of the GB200 series and the company’s increased capacity to test more complex GPU racks. Mizuho analysts also noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to target huge markets like the AI market worth over $1 trillion, a $500 billion enterprise AI sector, and a $50 trillion robotics market.

Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock: Wall Street Says “Load Up” Despite Monday’s Drop - MoneyCheck,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNX0dkRkVCX3FIUjJod0RTaVE0TnVDVlFSRnBadHZuQ1RqVkpCdHN5UGM3bC00emFHRnJFa1JYVEZMcUMzSmRrTTgyV3Y0R1V4RzFhdFFjOTlWX2pnbmZTSGpXWXR0VTBZdGhLSzNMaDZ1M0VkSzFObWdmRmpGSVp6LVhiNzJxdGFBbGlnd3pFM1M?oc=5,"Mon, 05 May 2025 11:43:53 GMT","TLDR:

NVIDIA stock fell 1.13% to $113.1 in premarket trading on Monday

The company faces potential 20% reduction in addressable market due to U.S. export restrictions

NVIDIA earned about 13% of annual revenue from China in the last fiscal year

Huawei’s 910D AI chip poses emerging competition to NVIDIA’s H100 in the Chinese market

Despite concerns, analyst Nauman Khan rates NVIDIA a “Strong Buy” with Wall Street setting a $164.23 price target

NVIDIA’s stock took a hit Monday morning as investors weighed continued strong AI spending against growing export restrictions and Chinese competition. The chip giant’s shares dropped 1.13% to $113.1 in premarket trading, despite having risen 2.6% on Friday and gaining over 17% in the past month.

The stock’s recent gains had been supported by major tech companies reaffirming their commitment to AI infrastructure investments. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.com all recently stated their intention to keep investing heavily in AI systems, which rely heavily on NVIDIA’s chips.

However, a shadow has fallen over these positive developments. BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya warns that U.S. export restrictions could reduce NVIDIA’s long-term total addressable market by 20%.

Half of this potential market reduction comes directly from China, based on the country’s contribution to global cloud capital expenditure. The remaining impact will depend on how strictly the U.S. administration implements AI diffusion rules.

Despite these challenges, Arya maintains a “Buy” rating on NVIDIA shares with a $150 target price.

Competition Heats Up in China

The export situation is becoming more complex with the emergence of domestic Chinese competitors. Huawei is making progress with its 910D AI chip, which analysts say could potentially take market share from NVIDIA’s H100 offering in China.

This threat is particularly concerning given the Trump administration’s restrictions on sales to China. Some industry observers worry that Huawei could become “the hardware of choice” for Chinese companies as a result.

NVIDIA has already disclosed that U.S. export restrictions will cause it to absorb losses of $5.5 billion in the recently ended quarter. This is a substantial hit, considering China represented approximately 13% of NVIDIA’s annual revenue in the last fiscal year.

Wall Street Remains Bullish

Despite these headwinds, many analysts remain optimistic about NVIDIA’s prospects. Five-star investor Nauman Khan acknowledges the risks but believes NVIDIA will maintain its market leadership.

“Trade tensions and rising competition pose risks, but NVIDIA’s deep partnerships with major cloud providers and upcoming Blackwell chips provide strong growth catalysts,” Khan explains.

Khan argues that Huawei’s 910D chips won’t seriously threaten NVIDIA’s dominance. He points out that NVIDIA’s forthcoming Blackwell GPU offers greater efficiency and better software integration.

The stock price decline has created a buying opportunity, according to Khan. He notes that NVIDIA currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24x, well below its five-year average of 65x.

“My suggestion is to load up while the price is attractive, and let NVIDIA’s AI juggernaut drive returns over the next several years,” Khan states.

Wall Street broadly shares this optimistic view. NVIDIA currently holds a “Strong Buy” consensus rating, with 34 Buy, 5 Hold, and 1 Sell recommendations.

The average 12-month price target stands at $164.23, representing a potential upside of over 40% from current levels.

Other chip makers also felt pressure on Monday, with Advanced Micro Devices down 0.76% and Broadcom falling 1.3% in premarket trading.

The recent stock price movement reflects the ongoing tension between NVIDIA’s central position in the AI boom and increasing geopolitical challenges to its global business."

"‘Sell Nvidia Stock’ (NVDA), Says Top Analyst - TipRanks",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5oc1ZhWVNsOUIxNFU4V24xTGltbUFTNW5FWXRIQnRDZU1NX2tZenZBMjBIVFM2UTFQM05UUzlFSGJ5TEpsS2kyaVBzdEgydmtOVU5LeFJZM2JSelNYU2MwNkpsT2RzRkJUSGVNZnVSb0E3bEstTUJTZg?oc=5,"Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:26:57 GMT","A leading technology analyst is urging investors to sell Nvidia (NVDA), arguing that the downside risks now outweigh any potential upside for the chipmaker.

Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg began coverage of NVDA stock with a Sell rating and a $100 price target. The price target is 6% below where Nvidia’s shares are currently trading. In his assessment, Goldberg cited a likely slowdown in A.I. spending beginning in 2026, as well as difficulties in installing Nvidia’s latest hardware.

It is a rare negative rating for NVDA stock from a Wall Street analyst, and it comes after the artificial intelligence (AI) server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) issued disappointing preliminary financial results, sending its stock down 15% on April 30. While most analysts remain bullish on Nvidia, the company and its stock have been fighting negative investor sentiment all year.

Complexities

In a research report, Goldberg wrote, “Our research indicates significant complexity required for deployments of Nvidia systems in comparison to traditional data centers—cooling, configuration and orchestration challenges throughout the supply chain.”

The analyst also stressed that Nvidia’s largest customers are each looking to design their own microchips and semiconductors, and are likely to eventually move away from the company. NVDA stock is down 3% on April 30 amid a broad decline in U.S. equity markets. So far in 2025, Nvidia’s share price has fallen 20%.

Is NVDA Stock a Buy?

The stock of Nvidia has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 40 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 35 Buy and five Hold recommendations assigned in the last three months. The average NVDA price target of $167.09 implies 57.13% upside from current levels.

Nvidia (NVDA) May Benefit as U.S. Weighs Easing Chip Curbs on UAE - GuruFocus,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxORDJGajB3d3R3UUxfVjVrbFhXSW5UT1FXVldOWG1MMVF4TWZ2Y3FKNHVfVHpNbEo2WjJGbjFUZzgzVHZtdkFwVHNKQXhDTnVBZENUNUFHRnh1RDlKZ1N0VFhybUNxeDJ3cTNrRVZCSElNNGV1SlFIdTNhN1FMT0RNX0Q4emFxLWlzRm5OdEhidkpmX0NfcWFqbXdqVkF4Mnhic2c?oc=5,"Mon, 05 May 2025 12:27:23 GMT","Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) may gain from regulatory changes as the U.S. considers easing AI chip export restrictions to the United Arab Emirates, Bloomberg reported. The review comes ahead of President Donald Trump's May 13–16 visit to the Gulf, overlapping with the AI diffusion rule's effective date.

The UAE plans to invest $1.4 trillion over the next decade in U.S. energy, semiconductor, and AI sectors, according to Bloomberg. The effort includes a $1.5 billion Microsoft-G42 partnership and a Mubadala-backed stake in Intel's Altera business.

Trump has questioned why a country cleared to buy F-35s faces chip restrictions. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang urged regulatory changes in Washington, warning that stringent export curbs could drive allies toward Chinese alternatives. Microsoft has similarly advocated for easing rules for “American friends,” according to the outlet.

Bloomberg noted that Trump officials may abandon the tiered diffusion rule in favor of global licensing, potentially allowing country-specific chip agreements. That shift could open up growth channels for Nvidia and peers amid intensifying global AI competition.

Investors should watch for policy signals during Trump's UAE visit, as regulatory shifts may reshape Nvidia's global AI strategy."

Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 4 Years? - The Motley Fool,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE1XSWtnVm93bHFPX01jamMyNE1LSmZ3QnRSNHowdnBOQmdNMnl0TTVCdS1Fa1RBSW9mMXUxZ2M1eEtJcnNoeEFQdzRLdDVDNEl1cTV0OHJxSjF0ZU9lY2QyWDFwdzZ4QV81bXNBZGZjaDhMZnJMc2h0cnBFOUdtRms?oc=5,"Mon, 05 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","Nvidia (NVDA -1.31%) has been the must-own stock for the artificial intelligence (AI) race. However, it sold off a fair bit over the past few months alongside the rest of the market. Currently, it sits around 25% to 30% down from its all-time high, trading at levels last seen during the late summer of 2024.

It's not often that a sale price comes around on a big-time winner like this, but today's sale price only really matters if Nvidia is still heading in the right direction a few years from now. So, where will Nvidia be in four years? The answer may surprise you.

Nvidia's business has been so dominant that competitors are starting to rise up

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) drive the company. Originally designed for processing gaming graphics, GPUs soon found many alternative uses. Due to their unique ability to process multiple calculations in parallel, they are useful for any task that requires intense computing power, such as training and running an AI model.

Nvidia isn't the only company making GPUs, but it dominates the market. Most estimates peg Nvidia's data center GPU market share above 90%, which is very impressive. However, with that kind of market share dominance, it invites other players to the industry, as Nvidia is making a ton of money from its GPUs.

Nvidia's profit margins have skyrocketed since the start of the AI race, and some of its clients are getting fed up with the price they must pay for Nvidia GPUs. So, they're starting to look for alternatives.

One area that many of the AI hyperscalers are looking toward is custom AI accelerators, such as those designed by Broadcom (AVGO -1.10%). These units are tailored to process one type of workload and can outperform Nvidia GPUs in certain applications, such as training and running AI models. However, they are tailored for a specific workload, making them inflexible to run others. This likely isn't a big deal, as many of the AI hyperscalers already know how they want their AI workloads to run.

As a result, Nvidia could see some competition coming its way, but it likely won't be enough to dethrone Nvidia as an investment.

There will be plenty of data center revenue to go around

The biggest factor for Nvidia investors is understanding where data center capital expenditures are going. If this spending falls off a cliff, Nvidia's revenue will follow. However, using outside data, Nvidia projects that data center capital expenditures will rise from around $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028.

Over the past 12 months, Nvidia has generated $115 billion from its data center division. If that $400 billion figure is true for 2024, that means it captured just shy of 30% of total data center spending. Should data center capital expenditures expand to the $1 trillion mark and Nvidia keep all of its market share, it would generate around $288 billion. That's monster growth, but Nvidia may not be able to capture all of it due to rising competition from custom AI accelerators.

Broadcom estimates that the addressable market will be between $60 billion and $90 billion from three major clients alone by 2027. That's about a third of Nvidia's projected 2028 revenue (if it captures all of it), so it's safe to say that Broadcom is targeting Nvidia's market share.

So, is Nvidia doomed over the next few years? I'd say no. The future will likely be a combination of GPUs and custom AI accelerators, meaning stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom will be successful investments. Will Nvidia have the rocket-ship growth it once did? Likely not. But it will likely still put up strong double-digit growth, making it a great candidate for a stock that can beat the market moving forward, especially if you can scoop up shares on sale right now.

However, if the data center market doesn't reach that projected figure, Nvidia's stock may struggle to rise, as its overall revenue may be capped and under pressure as competition rises."

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among Unknown Billionaire Phill Gross’ Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential - Yahoo Finance,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQSW1FVVFLV2MzbU5fVTB3dzAtRmJwVnBtRUJpejE5czNmVUEwMWphOW5nUzltX1VpMm1xMks0QXQ3aF9PUEFZcG1BUWZ4dWpDUWpNLTVEcjNvbWhXbW12Z3lKRzYtVldLQm12b1owdkV1QzZJc0c5Z1daQzJxSk5wb0VMOFZMTUVPX3FZ?oc=5,"Mon, 05 May 2025 14:30:14 GMT","Gross himself brings a deep background in healthcare investing, having served for nearly two decades at Harvard Management Company in various roles, including Healthcare and Retail Analyst, Equity Research Director, and Partner. His academic credentials include a B.S. in finance and economics (1982) and an M.S. in investments (1983), both from the University of Wisconsin. He remains actively engaged with his alma mater, serving on the advisory boards of the Steve Hawk Center for Applied Securities Analysis and the Nicholas Center for Applied Corporate Finance. In recognition of his professional accomplishments and ongoing contributions, Gross received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Wisconsin Business School in 2006.

Under Gross’s co-leadership, Adage has become a key player in managing assets for prominent institutional clients such as Harvard University, Dartmouth College, Northwestern University, the American Red Cross, and the Getty Foundation. The firm specializes in long/short equity strategies guided by fundamental analysis and engages in risk arbitrage and event-driven opportunities when market conditions are favourable. Adage Capital Management and its predecessor, the Select Equity Group at Harvard Management Company, have consistently outperformed broader market benchmarks by an average of 3.5% over the past 15 years. This is a testament to the disciplined, research-driven investment framework that Gross helped instill.

Phillip “Phill” Gross is a seasoned investor and influential figure in the world of institutional asset management, best known as the Co-founder, Managing Director, and Healthcare Portfolio Manager of Adage Capital Management . While Robert Atchinson, his longtime collaborator and fellow Co-founder, serves as the firm’s Portfolio Manager, Gross’s leadership and strategic vision have played a foundational role in shaping Adage’s long-term investment philosophy and reputation. The two met in the mid-1980s while working as Harvard University’s endowment analysts. Their professional synergy led them to leave Harvard Management Company in the 1990s, following public scrutiny over performance-based bonuses. With the backing of an initial $1.8 billion investment from Harvard and an agreement for the university to receive 10% of the firm’s earnings, they launched Adage Capital Management in 2001 alongside an 18-person team.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q4: 223

Adage Capital Management’s Equity Stake: $3.10 Billion

Upside Potential as of May 2: 44.30%

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in GPU-accelerated computing, driving innovation across industries such as gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive technologies. The company’s graphics processing units and AI chips play a foundational role in emerging technologies, from powering immersive gaming experiences to enabling complex data center operations and artificial intelligence platforms. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, NVIDIA reported a record revenue of $39.3 billion, reflecting an impressive 78% increase compared to the same period the previous year. Its GAAP earnings per diluted share rose to $0.89, underscoring the company’s exceptional performance and the robust demand for its AI and data infrastructure products.

Despite its commercial success, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has faced challenges amid growing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, particularly regarding restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductors. The U.S. government, through new Commerce Department regulations, now requires NVIDIA to obtain export licenses for the H20 AI chip, which was originally developed to meet prior export limitations. This development is part of a broader U.S. strategy to limit China’s access to cutting-edge AI technology while investing heavily in domestic semiconductor production. In alignment with this policy, NVIDIA announced a $500 billion investment in AI server infrastructure within the United States, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), one of its key manufacturing partners, committed an additional $100 billion to bolster its operations in Arizona. These moves reflect the growing emphasis on reshoring critical tech capabilities and reducing reliance on international supply chains.

To maintain its foothold in China—a market that contributed 13% of its total revenue last year—NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang traveled to Beijing to meet with high-ranking government officials. During his visit, Huang reiterated NVIDIA’s commitment to the Chinese market, signaling the company’s intent to preserve collaborative relationships in the region despite escalating trade restrictions. Nevertheless, investor confidence in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains robust. The company’s stock has a bullish price target of $165.22, indicating an upside potential of 44.30%, effectively placing it among the huge upside potential stock picks of billionaire Phill Gross.

Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:

“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. Shares contributed to performance during the quarter, driven by strong demand for its data center products, especially the Hopper H200 chips, which generated double-digit billions in revenue, marking the fastest product ramp in the company’s history. Management provided fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance above analyst estimates, along with resilient operating margins supported by robust demand and limited competition. In our view, Nvidia’s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure, including advancements in inference and test-time scaling (i.e., reasoning during inference), is driving adoption among enterprises and startups, providing continued demand for its high-performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed for inference and new clusters are deployed, we believe Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on growing compute needs across AI applications.”

Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of unknown billionaire Phill Gross’ stock picks with huge upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

Nvidia's New Challenge: US Lawmaker Wants Company To Track Its Chips To Avoid Smuggling In China - Benzinga,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizwFBVV95cUxOZlpMZlUzbGRZYVBGM0pydC1kMVAyQTJxQnRCTWQwcVcxNzctcW1ib0dwQUFuWnJkd0NtTEpuMl9nOUxCa3phME0tajBPQTNIQ1dxU0E4cUdLRFNNbW5KUGVwZVpGMmJEVzJDWjNDZWZFVk9VQktRNWVneGN0VjdXVjNKd2JYNHkzcDgyYU9DejdWdVRUMGQwR3ZnRl9xbDZqaWNRRHgxRFFUcklEYUNFRHNYck11akRIb3BCWnpGek52VndqWFFPdDFJZGpEWGc?oc=5,"Mon, 05 May 2025 14:36:58 GMT","The Trump administration has intensified semiconductor sanctions on top of its tariff policies.

The U.S. plans to introduce a ruling to verify the location of Nvidia Corp NVDA and peer-made artificial intelligence chips to prevent their smuggling into China, Reuters reported on Monday.

Nvidia stock is trading lower after the report.

The Biden administration had already restricted China’s access to sophisticated semiconductor technology, including AI, citing national security threats.

Nvidia’s chips are critical to creating AI systems, including chatbots and image generators, to ones that can help craft biological weapons.

Reports have often indicated Nvidia AI chips flowing into China via illegal routes, and Nvidia has publicly acknowledged its failure to track its products after sales.

U.S. Representative Bill Foster, a Democrat from Illinois, plans to introduce a bill that would direct U.S. regulators to forge rules for tracking chips to ensure they remain in their legal location.

Reportedly, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, whose AI systems posed a strong challenge to U.S. systems, were built with advanced Nvidia chips, Reuters cited SemiAnalysis.

Alphabet Inc’s GOOG GOOGL Google already tracks the location of its in-house AI chips and others for security purposes, Reuters cited unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

Foster’s legislation would give the U.S. Department of Commerce six months to develop laws requiring the technology.

Reportedly, Chinese tech giants, including ByteDance, Alibaba Group Holding BABA, and Tencent Holding TCEHY, hoarded billions of dollars worth of Nvidia’s H20 AI chips amid U.S. sanctions.

They aimed to snap up 1 million H20s before the latest U.S. semiconductor sanctions kicked in. The companies reportedly placed over $16 billion in orders for the quarter.

Nvidia has bagged $18 billion of H20 orders since 2025 beginning. China has generated $17 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, accounting for 13% of Nvidia’s total sales.

Price Actions: NVDA stock is down by 1.31% at $113.01 at the last check on Monday.

Big Money Is Betting Against Nvidia Stock Even as Sentiment Improves - The Globe and Mail,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7AFBVV95cUxQaGFuZWNPMEhSSHAyallmM2QtZ1hDU1BrWTJock5kTDN3QmR1cXZHLWJGOWI5WmVYWGYzRnk1MGVfYWVuYm5YWHF2TTVBYWg5S3NnV2U4R21RM2N4V0NHSUxXcWl0X3dmMjl0bzVxZ2ZOMjBJcUZDejI0cmllcEtXaC12S01FOGc1U2hLRmJ6NXhNRGJRVVJ0NmtKWXRvc012VWJDRGxOcGx4V0FhcGRuc3BUckpCLTBBdTlodWJiMVFyb2dMSTJKMkRqYVI0dzhHRDB1ODRKTDR1cW9JRzg5Rk9wZGJXNU1GVTBBRg?oc=5,"Mon, 05 May 2025 14:22:00 GMT","Thanks to the recent rally, Nvidia (NVDA) has narrowed its year-to-date losses to just about 15%. The stock has whipsawed this year as news from China and the White House has impacted investor sentiment. Recently, commentary from tech giants during their first-quarter earnings calls has helped drive NVDA shares higher.

In this article, we’ll examine what leading tech companies had to say about their artificial intelligence (AI) capex during the recent earnings call and examine what Big Money is doing about Nvidia.

Tech Companies Continue to Invest in AI

To begin with, tech companies are not backing off their AI capex. For instance, Amazon’s Q1 capex was $24.3 billion, which is consistent with its 2025 guide of “around $100 billion.” During the Q1 2025 earnings call, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said that “the majority of this spend is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure.”

He added, “It primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI services and increasingly in custom silicon like Trainium.” Notably, companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG), which are among the major buyers of Nvidia’s chips, are also working on their own custom chips. While they will continue buying Nvidia’s top-of-the-line GPUs, they are looking to route some money toward their in-house chips.

Days before the earnings call, speaking at a conference organized by the Hamm Institute for American Energy, Amazon’s vice president of global data centers, Kevin Miller, refuted reports of a data center slowdown, saying, “There’s been really no significant change.” He added, “We continue to see very strong demand, and we’re looking both in the next couple years as well as long term and seeing the numbers only going up.”

Microsoft Maintained Capex Guidance

Microsoft (MSFT) also maintained its capex guidance and downplayed reports of the cancellation of some data center leases. In the March quarter, the company’s capex did fall sequentially after many quarters, but CFO Amy Hood attributed it to “normal variability from the timing of delivery of data center leases.” Microsoft also maintained its previous guidance and said that capex growth in its fiscal year 2026, which will begin in July, will be lower than that of the current fiscal year. Also, it said that the capex would be tilted towards short-lived assets that are “more directly correlated to revenue than long-lived assets.”

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, incidentally, is among the rare tech leaders in the U.S. who have talked about the possibility of a GPU oversupply in the future, which could drive down prices.

Data Center Growth

During its earnings call last month, data center supplier Vertiv (VRT) also pointed to continued spending toward data centers, which CEO Giordano Albertazzi said would drive the company’s short-term as well as long-term growth.

Alphabet also gave an upbeat commentary on its AI capex and said the significant increase in capex in recent quarters “reflects confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business.” CFO Ruth Porat added, “we expect quarterly capex throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level.”

The best news for Nvidia investors, meanwhile, came from Meta Platforms (META), whose Q1 earnings call was predominantly focused on the company’s AI strategy. Meta raised its 2025 capex guidance to between $64 billion and $72 billion compared to the previous guidance of $60 billion to $65 billion. The higher guidance is on account of increased outlay toward data centers.

Elon Musk’s xAI is also said to be considering a $20 billion capital raise. The billionaire’s AI company is expected to use a significant percentage of the capital raise to build its AI hardware infrastructure, which would invariably mean buying more chips from Nvidia.

Overall, I would say that the commentary on AI capex was reasonably bullish during the recent earnings calls, especially given concerns over the possibility of tech giants rethinking their aggressive capex.

Nvidia Stock Forecast

That said, not all analysts are sold on Nvidia’s growth story. Last week, Seaport Global Securities analyst Jay Goldberg downgraded Nvidia to a “Sell,” assigning a Street-low target price of $100. Goldberg happens to be the only major Wall Street analyst to have a “Sell” rating on NVDA – something which would have almost seemed blasphemous a couple of months back.

However, brokerages have been somewhat circumspect on Nvidia, and several sell-side analysts slashed Nvidia’s target price last month amid the escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

Big Money also seems wary of Nvidia, and the latest Barron’spoll of professional investors shows that 15 of the 119 participants thought Nvidia was the most overvalued stock in the market. Only Tesla (TSLA), which has always divided Wall Street over its valuation, was rated more overvalued.

To sum it up, market sentiments have improved significantly after the recent tech earnings, as concerns over a slowdown in AI spending by U.S. tech giants have abated for now. However, concerns over the long-term sustainability of Nvidia's growth trajectory and rising competition from China are making some apprehensive. We'll probably get to hear more on this later this month when Nvidia reports quarterly earnings."
