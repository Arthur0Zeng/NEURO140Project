NVDA,2025-05-05 10:50:54,0.5,"Sentiment Score: 0.5

The projected movement indicates a very short-term correction followed by a relatively flat trend. After an initial spike upward, the price appears to be correcting downwards. However, after that correction the price stabilizes and seems to flatten out for the remainder of the forecast period, indicating neither strong bullish nor bearish momentum. Therefore, a neutral sentiment is appropriate."
